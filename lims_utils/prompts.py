This summary should be formatted in Markdown. Do not say "Here is a summary", just start with the first header.

First provide a structured header with the following information under the title "## Meeting Information":
- Date: The date of the meeting
- Title: The title of the meeting
- Present: Which council members were present
- Absent: Which council members were absent. Only include council members who are explicitly marked absent. 
- Guests: Which invited guests were present.
- Votes: The total number of votes that were taken, either by voice or roll call.

Next, choose between 4 and 8 agenda items under a section called "## Highlights". Here are some rules to follow about what to include in the highlights:
- This should be a bulleted list.
- Omit honorary resolutions, proclamations, and other ceremonial items.
- Omit license applications, such as liquor, gambling, or hours of operation.
- Omit mundane administrative matters, such as accepting minutes
- Include all settlements or litigation that may suggest wrongdoing or liability on the part of the city.
- Include anything that happens in closed session.
- Always include anything that receives any discussion or debate, or that does not pass unanimously, even if it's one of the items listed above.
- In general, focus on topics that the council members seemed to care about or that received significant public attention.
- In general, omit topics that received little discussion or debate, or that passed unanimously.
- Do not attempt to make this summary a particular length.  Asses each agenda item on its own merits.

Next, for each of the topics you chose to highlight, provide a more detailed explanation of the discussion that took place undet the header "## Discussion".
- Each topic should have its own subheader.
- Include a summary of the main points made by council members, guests, or members of the public.
- Include any details about the tone of the conversation or attitues expressed if they seem strongly expressed.
- If there was a debate, include the main points made by each side and expand a bit on the reasoning behind each side's position.
- Include a direct quote for debates or longer discussions.
- The length of each summary should be relative to the length of the discussion.
- Include any decisions that were made.
- Always include the vote count at the end of the summary.

Finally, provide a summary of the public comments under the header "## Public Comments".
Include the name of the commenter and a detailed summary of the comment, as well as any responses from council members.
Every public comment should be included. Grouping is OK but don't attempt to summarize them all together.
