## Discussion

### HERC Closure Resolution
The committee discussed and passed a resolution calling for the closure of the HERC waste incinerator by 2027. Chair Cashman emphasized the need to move away from both landfilling and burning trash toward a circular economy focused on reuse and recycling. The resolution included an amendment strengthening commitments to labor transitions.

Councilmember Chowdhury introduced language ensuring "workers are brought along in the shift toward a carbon-free solid waste management system." The discussion acknowledged the approximately 350 jobs connected to HERC operations.

Chair Cashman noted: "We are seeking a circular economy that is one of sharing, repairing, reusing, recycling... The HERC incinerator is not part of that circular economy. So we need to shut it down."

Vote: Passed unanimously

### Traffic Safety Camera Pilot Framework
Ethan Foley presented the framework for implementing traffic safety cameras in 2025, starting with 5 speed cameras and expanding to include red light cameras. The presentation emphasized goals of improving safety while building community trust and ensuring equitable implementation.

Councilmember Vetaw noted the evolution of community attitudes toward cameras since previous attempts: "Back then, it was primarily North Side people who were advocating against it... And now because of other reasons, people are a lot more accepting of it and welcoming of it."

The framework includes extensive community engagement starting February 2024 and coordination with Hennepin County and MnDOT for potential camera locations on their roadways.

Report received and filed.

### Street Conditions Report
Public Works presented concerning trends in street maintenance, showing increasing miles of streets in poor condition. Without changes to funding levels, the average pavement condition is projected to be "very poor" by 2030. The asphalt resurfacing program has decreased from 25-33 miles annually to just 8 miles planned for next year due to inflation and competing priorities.

Report received and filed.
