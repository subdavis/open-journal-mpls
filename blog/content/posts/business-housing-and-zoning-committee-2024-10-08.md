## Discussion

### Food Vendor Location Options and Regulations

Council Members Chowdhury and Chavez presented a legislative directive aimed at supporting local food vendors, particularly from immigrant communities. The directive seeks to expand vending locations, review licensing processes, and address fines and citations issues. 

Chavez emphasized the need for more accessible and affordable licensing:

"We've heard multiple concerns from community members how expensive licenses can be. How current vendors are getting the police called on them and sent to them and getting fines and citations up to $250 because they are trying to sell this food and make a living."

The directive includes provisions for equitable fee systems, accessibility regardless of immigration status, and a review of fines and citations issued to unlicensed vendors.

Council Member Rainville raised concerns about coordination with the Park Board, as many vendors operate on parkland. Chavez clarified that while they can't control Park Board policies, they hope to work together to find solutions.

The item was approved as part of the consent agenda.

### Conditional Use Permit for 1801 Nicollet Avenue

The committee discussed a conditional use permit for a recuperative care facility at 1801 Nicollet Avenue. Following community meetings, two additional conditions were added:

1. Providing one designated drop-off space in the surface parking lot.
2. Appointing a community liaison officer as a primary contact for local businesses and residents.

Council members expressed concerns about the state's paused licensing process for such facilities. Council Member Cashman suggested engaging with the Department of Human Services to understand their plans for resuming permitting.

Council Member Ellison moved to deny the appeal and grant the conditional use permit with the additional conditions, noting the limited grounds for denial and potential legal exposure.

The motion to deny the appeal and grant the conditional use permit passed.

### Appeal Hearing for 5005 Lyndale Avenue South Development

The committee heard an appeal regarding a variance for a proposed four-story, 20-unit development at 5005 Lyndale Avenue South. The variance would reduce the corner yard setback from 31 feet to 15 feet.

Staff explained that the unique circumstances of the lot, formed by combining three parcels, justified the variance. Some residents expressed concerns about traffic safety and the building's scale.

Council Member Ellison moved to deny the appeal, criticizing the appellant's arguments:

"Mr. Geotz, in your presentation, we expect to hear a counter that is responsive to the facts. And instead, we got from yourself and lawyer 'give me a break. It's a rectangle.' That's not germane to the facts."

The motion to deny the appeal passed.

### Twin Cities Housing Alliance Presentation

Representatives from the Twin Cities Housing Alliance presented on housing challenges in the region. They highlighted issues such as rising operating costs, security concerns, and the need for supportive services in housing.

Dr. Eric Anthony Johnson from Aeon emphasized the crisis facing nonprofit housing providers:

"We're in a crisis situation. When I talk about close to 6,000 units, expect organizations to probably drop down to 2,500 units."

Council members expressed concern about the scale of the problem and discussed potential solutions, including federal strategies and public-private partnerships.

No formal action was taken on this discussion item.
