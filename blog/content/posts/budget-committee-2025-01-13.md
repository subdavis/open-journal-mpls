## Discussion

### Bureau Chief Civilian Position in Police Department
Chief O'Hara presented a proposal to create a new civilian executive position equivalent to Deputy Chief level. The position would report to the Assistant Police Chief of Community Trust and Engagement, with a salary range of $158,652 to $188,071. The role would oversee constitutional policing, internal affairs, training, and reform efforts.

Chief O'Hara emphasized that similar civilian leadership positions exist in other major police departments, including New York, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. He argued that civilian leadership would bring diverse perspectives and help modernize the department, particularly during the implementation of state and federal consent decree reforms.

Several council members asked clarifying questions:
- Council Member Rainville inquired about the success of similar positions in other cities
- Council Member Jenkins asked about desired qualifications
- Council Member Chowdhury questioned the timeline and recruitment strategy

Chief O'Hara indicated he has already identified a potential candidate within Minnesota with relevant experience.

Quote from Chief O'Hara: "I think it's clear that when you bring civilians in on this level it has to be real both internally and externally. The civilian needs to clearly have the same level of authority as sworn members on that level."

Vote: Passed unanimously
