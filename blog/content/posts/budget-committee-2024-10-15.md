## Discussion

### Deputy Director of Civil Rights Appointed Position

Brenda Miller from the Human Resources Department presented the new appointed position of Deputy Director of Civil Rights. The position will assist the Director of Civil Rights in managing day-to-day operations of the Civil Rights Department. The 2024 salary range for this position is approximately $150,000 to $178,000. The committee approved the position without discussion.

Vote: Passed unanimously by voice vote.

### Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) Presentation

MPHA representatives presented an update on levy capital deployment and proposed new funding. Key points included:

- MPHA has a $260 million capital backlog due to aging housing stock and federal disinvestment.
- The city's reinstated levy provides $5 million annually for preservation and production work.
- MPHA outlined their 2024 levy budget and five-year plan, including high-rise preservation, new unit production, and elevator modernization projects.
- MPHA is piloting a new HUD funding tool called Faircloth to RAD for the Springs redevelopment project.

Council members expressed support for MPHA's efforts and discussed the challenges of addressing the capital backlog and creating new affordable housing units.

### Resolution to Amend 2024 General Appropriation Resolution

Council Member Wonsley introduced a resolution to amend the 2024 General Appropriation Resolution to allocate funds within the Health Department's existing budget for a pollution control annual registration program for carbon dioxide emissions. The resolution aimed to address concerns raised in Mayor Frey's veto of the 2025 fee schedule.

Discussion centered around the feasibility of implementing the program in 2024 and the process for creating a new FTE position. Deputy Commissioner of Health Daniel Hanlon stated that the Health Department does not have available funds in the 2024 budget for this program.

Council Member Koski moved to forward the item without recommendation to allow for further discussions with HR, Budget, and the Health Department.

Council President Payne emphasized the urgency of addressing climate change: "The climate crisis is not waiting around for J.A.Q.'s. The climate crisis is not waiting for the State Department to figure out what the options for cost capture and isn't waiting around for HR to figure out what the right capacity is to be responsive for this request."

Vote: Passed 8-2 to forward without recommendation.
