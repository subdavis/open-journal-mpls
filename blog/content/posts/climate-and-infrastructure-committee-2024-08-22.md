## Discussion

### Transit Project Area Update

The committee heard a presentation from Jessica Hike on updating the Value Capture District (VCD) project area map for transit financing. The update expands the transit line coverage downtown and to the city's southern limit. This change aligns with Metro Transit's Network Next plan and efforts to improve downtown transit. The update does not change the taxable district. The committee passed the resolution unanimously.

### West Broadway Improvement Special Service District Extension

David Bower presented on extending the expiration date of the West Broadway Improvement Special Service District to December 31, 2025. This extension will allow staff to continue working with district representatives on the formal district renewal process and evaluate future service delivery options. The committee passed the ordinance unanimously.

### Stormwater Management Ordinance Amendment

Kelly Mullman presented on amending the stormwater management ordinance to meet state and federal Clean Water Act requirements and improve water resources in the city. The changes include reorganizing sections, simplifying language, and adding references to state permits and city guides. The committee passed the ordinance unanimously.

### Hennepin County Solid Waste Management Plan

Hennepin County representatives presented their plan to reinvent the solid waste system and potentially close the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) between 2028 and 2040. The presentation sparked significant discussion among committee members about the timeline for closure, environmental justice concerns, and the city's role in waste reduction.

Councilmember Chavez expressed concern about the loss of funding for environmental programs if HERC closes:

> "I see the closure of the HERC as an environmental justice issue. It is something that is very close to the heart of many Ward 9 residents when it comes to fighting the Roof Depot site, fighting highways that continue to pollute residents in Philip, Smith Foundry, roadways that have historically been a burden to many residents of color and immigrants in the community I represent."

Councilmember Vetaw disagreed with setting a specific closure date without more concrete plans:

> "I just don't understand what -- like I feel like a resolution at this point from the City of Minneapolis would definitely be a greeting card, because there's nothing solid here about 2028 to 2040. If we don't have an actual plan in place. And this isn't like -- this isn't something that is just going to happen like that."

No vote was taken on this discussion item.

## Public Comments

Leslie Jackson: Thanked Kelly Mullman for her work on the Green Zones and changes to the stormwater ordinance. Jackson noted that these changes will help address flooding issues in North Minneapolis.

Janet Court: Expressed appreciation for the city's work on improving drainage and water quality in Powderhorn Park. Court noted that flooding issues have been reduced and water quality in the pond has improved.
