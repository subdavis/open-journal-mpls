## Discussion

### Neighborhood and Community Relations Department Budget

Director Karen M presented the 2025 budget for the Neighborhood and Community Relations Department. Key points included:

- Restructuring of the department to improve efficiency
- Expansion of the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs
- Challenges in building trust with residents due to national events and trends
- Successful merger of some neighborhood organizations

Council members expressed support for the department's work but raised concerns about the increasing needs of immigrant and refugee populations. Council Member Chavez stated:

"We're starting to see homelessness skyrocket. And we are starting to see a variety of new arrivals coming to schools and in the city, frankly. We're starting to see even folks coming to City Hall asking for services."

The director acknowledged the growing need but noted that no new programming or funding was proposed in the mayor's budget to specifically address this issue.

### Arts and Cultural Affairs Department Budget

Director Ben Johnson presented the 2025 budget for the Arts and Cultural Affairs Department. Key proposals included:

- $1,430,000 for expansion of Vibrant Storefronts and Cultural Districts programs
- $1,150,000 for Cowles Center dance programming
- $300,000 for art preservation at George Floyd Square

The Cowles Center funding proposal generated significant discussion. Council members expressed support for the dance community and the importance of maintaining the venue's cultural legacy. Director Johnson explained:

"When the Cowles closed, it decimated our dance company and community. In response, the dance community self-organized and conducted three town halls and many ongoing community gatherings. And the funding request is a direct result of the community and relationship to the venue."

Council members also discussed the art preservation project at George Floyd Square, emphasizing the need for community involvement and sensitivity in the process.

### Intergovernmental Relations Department Budget

Director Katie Topanga presented the 2025 budget for the Intergovernmental Relations Department. Key points included:

- Proposed transfer of an FTE from the Health Department to IGR for energy policy work
- $50,000 in one-time funds for continued work on federal funding opportunities
- Success in securing federal tax credits for city projects

Council members expressed support for the department's work, particularly in securing federal funding and tax credits. There was also discussion about the importance of maintaining subject matter expertise in energy policy with the proposed position transfer.
