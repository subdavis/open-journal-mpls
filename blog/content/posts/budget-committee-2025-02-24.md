## Discussion

### Procurement Practices Review
Vice Chair Koski introduced a legislative directive for comprehensive review of procurement practices for contracts under $175,000. The directive aims to increase transparency and accountability in city spending. While initially proposed as a 10-year review, discussion revealed data only exists from 2019 onward due to system limitations. Councilmember Palmisano raised concerns about the scope of work, but CFO confirmed the review would focus on available data from 2019.

Quote from Vice Chair Koski: "This is an opportunity to not only address existing concerns, but also to set a new standard for transparency and integrity moving forward."

Vote: Passed with one abstention

### Director of Talent Acquisition Position
HR presented a proposal to elevate the Talent Acquisition Manager position to Director level (Grade 12, salary range starting at $128,364). The position will oversee 16 staff members and incorporate leadership of the Urban Scholars internship program, recently transferred from Civil Rights. Director Odom confirmed the Urban Scholars program is on track to launch under HR management, with applications opening in early March and higher-than-expected participation from city departments.

Vote: Passed unanimously
