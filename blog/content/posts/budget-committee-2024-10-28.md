## Discussion

### Director of Administration Position in City Attorney's Office
City Attorney Anderson explained this was a conversion of an existing Operations Manager position from classified to unclassified service, not a new position. The role will be part of the management team with increased responsibilities. The position was evaluated at Grade 11 with a salary range of $111,000-$132,000. Approved by voice vote.

### Deputy Director of Records Management Position
The Clerk's Office requested reclassification of an existing position due to significant growth in responsibilities, particularly in data practices team which has expanded from 3 to 14 people. The position was evaluated at Grade 11 with a salary range of $112,000-$133,000. Approved by voice vote.

### Financial Reporting Discussion
Extensive debate occurred regarding transparency in financial reporting and budget processes. Council Member Koski pressed for more detailed financial information and questioned whether departments could commit current year savings to future budgets without authorization. Notable exchange:

> "Would it be accurate to state that the current year's budget savings... cannot and will not be used to lower the 2025 property tax levy?" - Council Member Koski

Deputy CFO Choff emphasized that while projections can be made, official recognition of funds requires completed audits. Council Member Palmisano defended the Finance Department's work, citing their 49-year streak of excellence in financial reporting. Discussion revealed tension between council oversight and administrative autonomy in financial matters.
