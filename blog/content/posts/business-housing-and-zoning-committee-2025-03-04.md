## Discussion

### Rental License Conditions
City attorneys presented evidence of 223 code violations, 32 nuisance abatements, and substantial delinquent taxes across 22 rental properties owned by Khan and Ali. The owners admitted to violations but requested reducing the compliance period from 3 years to 1 year. Council was unanimous in supporting the full 3-year condition period, citing the systematic nature of violations.

Quote from Council Member Ellison: "People deserve to live with dignity in their housing... I'm happy to continue discussion but I will make a motion for us to follow staff's recommendation on this item."

Passed unanimously.

### J.P. Morgan Sign Variance 
J.P. Morgan requested permission to place signage on a non-primary building wall facing Washington Avenue. While council members expressed sympathy for the wayfinding needs of the business, concerns were raised about setting precedent. The committee forwarded without recommendation to allow time to develop findings of fact that could support approval.

Quote from Council Member Ellison: "At its face, I think this isn't that big of a deal. But the ripple effects of what this could mean for us as a quasi judicial body are really concerning to me and I want to make sure we're consistent."

Forwarded without recommendation.

### Historic Grain Elevator Demolition
Extensive debate over the proposed demolition of the 1914 grain elevator. The appellant argued for adaptive reuse as affordable housing, while the developer cited contamination issues and economic infeasibility. Staff and HPC had recommended approval of demolition. Council members acknowledged preservation goals but agreed the site needed activation.

Quote from Council Member Chowdhury: "Without a demolition, we're going to just see neither adaptive reuse nor new activity that would bring life to this area and our community and we would just be at a standstill."

Motion to deny appeal passed unanimously.
