## Discussion

### Personal Delivery Device Pilot Program

The committee discussed the creation of a one-year pilot program for personal delivery devices (autonomous robots) at the University of Minnesota. Council members expressed both excitement and concerns about the program. The devices will deliver food from three restaurants on campus.

Council Member Chowdhury inquired about the evaluation standards and potential expansion of the service. Dylan Freed from Public Works explained that they would monitor safety issues, customer feedback, and overall performance.

Council Member Chavez raised concerns about potential job losses, to which Freed responded that no current delivery jobs would be affected, and the program might create new jobs.

Council Member Vetaw expressed enthusiasm for the program, stating, "I think this is super cool! When the University staff met with me about this, I was, like, 'When? How, where do I see them? Am I going to move over there to, you know like, watch the robots delivering food and goods?'"

The motion to approve the pilot program passed unanimously.

### Right-of-Way Franchise Holder Exemptions

Aaron Johnson presented an amendment to the city ordinance language regarding right-of-way franchise holder exemptions. The change aims to eliminate conflicts with state law and ensure compliance with Minnesota Statutes.

Council Member Osman raised concerns about permitting fees for affordable housing projects, although it was noted that this issue was separate from the current ordinance change.

The ordinance amendment passed unanimously.

### Minneapolis Park and Recreation 2023 Annual Report

The Deputy Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent for Planning presented the 2023 Annual Report for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. They highlighted the progress made in implementing the 20-Year Neighborhood Park Plan (NPP20), which provides funding for park improvements through 2036.

Key points included:
- The program is addressing parks with the highest equity needs first
- By 2034 or 2035, every neighborhood park in Minneapolis will have been improved
- Accessibility improvements have consistently received the most funding

Council Member Vetaw asked about the progress of improvements in North Side parks and specifically about the North Commons project. The Assistant Superintendent assured that North Side parks remain a priority and that the North Commons project is critically important.

The report was received and filed without objection.
