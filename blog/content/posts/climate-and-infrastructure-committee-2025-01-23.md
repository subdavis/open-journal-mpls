## Discussion

### Boulevard Ordinance Changes
The committee discussed updates to the Boulevard Ordinance, focusing on allowing more flexible use of boulevards while maintaining safety and accessibility. Key changes include:
- Allowing nonthorny shrubs and hedges without permits
- Requiring permits for raised planter beds
- Waiving permit fees in Green Zones
- Establishing clear zones for emergency services access

Director Elwood emphasized the balance between community use and safety considerations. Several council members expressed support but raised concerns about permit requirements and fees. Councilmember Chowdhury suggested exploring ways to make the program more accessible through on-site permitting and potential funding for raised beds in Green Zones.

Vote: Passed 5-1 (Chavez abstaining)

### George Floyd Square Concept Layout
This discussion centered on two main options for the space: a flexible open concept versus a pedestrian plaza/mall. The debate revealed deep divisions over trust, community access, and the memorial's future.

Nathan Coster presented survey results showing 100% of adjacent property owners opposed both the cul-de-sac option and full closure option. However, there was more openness to occasional closures for events.

Councilmember Chavez emphasized the trust deficit between the community and city government:
> "They're asking the same government that murdered George Floyd to trust you. To trust the city enterprise they're going to build a pedestrian mall five years, 10 years down the road. That's not happening."

Councilmember Vetaw countered:
> "I signed up to be a councilmember because I want to bridge that gap of trust. I don't want to keep going into my community and saying 'You don't trust government.'"

The committee voted to continue the discussion to February 6th due to ongoing concerns about implementation details and community impact.

Vote: Passed by voice vote
