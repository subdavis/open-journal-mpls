## Discussion

### Minneapolis Convention Center Budget

Jeff Johnson presented the 2025 budget for the Minneapolis Convention Center and Downtown Assets Fund. Key points included:

- The Convention Center is still recovering from the pandemic, with occupancy not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until late 2025 or 2026.
- The Downtown Assets Fund balance is around $70 million, which covers multiple venues.
- The Convention Center is 35 years old and may need significant investment in the near future to remain competitive.

Council members expressed interest in the economic impact of the Convention Center, particularly in job creation. Council Member Rainville asked about the number of Minneapolis residents working in the hospitality industry:

> "Do you have any idea or could you have any idea how many Minneapolis residents work in the hotel and restaurant industry... if that number is available, so you can show the body how important the jobs creation is in that hospitality industry?"

Johnson responded that there are about 30,000 hospitality jobs in Minneapolis, with the Convention Center itself supporting about 7,000 jobs.

Council members also inquired about the process for determining capital improvements and the use of local option sales tax revenue. No vote was taken on this item.

### Opioid Response Strategies

The Health Department presented its opioid response strategies, including:

- Continuation of the Narcan vending machine program
- Implementation of new medications for opioid use disorder treatment
- A mobile medical unit for outreach and treatment

Council members expressed strong support for these initiatives but also raised concerns about the need for more resources and strategic placement of Narcan vending machines. Council Member Chavez asked:

> "What is the $99,000 going to get us? Is there a plan to fund a specific amount in the city in the coming year? What are the costs to install one Narcan machine? Two, what does it cost to maintain the Narcan machine? And, three, are we thinking about adding naloxone test strips to the machines or using the money to purchase additional?"

Deputy Commissioner Richie explained that each vending machine costs about $10,000 to install, with additional costs for maintenance and refilling. The department is exploring partnerships to help sustain the program and expand its reach. No vote was taken on this item.

### Climate Legacy Initiative

Deputy Commissioner Hanlon presented the Climate Legacy Initiative funding request of approximately $1.3 million for 2025. This includes:

- Two FTE positions for green jobs and climate incentive project management
- Funding for community outreach and engagement
- Urban forestry initiatives
- Biochar operations for carbon sequestration

The initiative aims to follow the White House Justice 40 standard, ensuring that at least 40% of funding goes to disadvantaged communities or low-income members. Hanlon noted that their programs often exceed this standard, reaching around 60%. No vote was taken on this item.

### Lead Elimination Action Plan

The Health Department requested $1.1 million for the Lead Elimination Action Plan, which aims to eliminate lead poisoning from home causes by 2035. The funding would support:

- Continuation of four FTE positions previously funded by ARPA
- Preventive inspections and financial assistance for approximately 150 homes per year

Deputy Commissioner Hanlon emphasized that the program primarily serves BIPOC communities and low-income households:

> "87% of the customers identify as people of color. It is predominantly in low-income households, as well, with 80% of the folks we serve are low-income residents."

No vote was taken on this item.
