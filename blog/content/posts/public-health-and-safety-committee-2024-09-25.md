## Discussion

### Regulations of Adult Bathhouses and Adult Sex Venues

Ashley from the City Auditor's Policy and Research Division presented findings on regulations for adult bathhouses and adult sex venues. The presentation included definitions, examples from other cities, and potential next steps for Minneapolis. Currently, these establishments are prohibited in Minneapolis due to various ordinances.

Council members expressed interest in potentially allowing these venues, with Chair Chavez noting it could be a pro-LGBTQIA+ action. Council Member Palmisano raised concerns about environmental impacts, particularly air pollution from wood-burning saunas.

Next steps could include revising or removing certain ordinances, working with the state to create exceptions, and potentially creating new regulations specific to these types of businesses.

### Minneapolis Tree Advisory Commission Annual Report

The Tree Advisory Commission presented their annual report, highlighting the importance of trees for climate change mitigation, socioeconomic benefits, and public health. They reported on accomplishments, challenges, and recommendations for the urban forest.

Key recommendations included fully funding the budget for tree planting, protecting the urban forest via policy, and expanding the urban canopy with private citizens. The commission emphasized the need for $1 million annually to plant 10,000 trees, which is currently underfunded.

Council members expressed support for the commission's work and discussed potential funding sources and collaboration with other departments and jurisdictions.

Council Member Rainville said: "If you two could please keep in touch with me. I would like to help you on that. Maybe you can start by having the Elm Tree visit the County Board to make them aware of trees."

### Safe and Thriving Community Action Plan Update

Vice Chair Wonsley provided an update on the Safe and Thriving Community Action Plan, emphasizing the need for formal adoption of the plan to ensure long-term implementation and accountability. She highlighted the lack of new funding in the 2025 budget for specific projects outlined in the plan.

Commissioner Cotton and Director Harrington responded, affirming their commitment to the plan but noting challenges in aligning implementation with budget cycles and the multidisciplinary nature of the work.

Chair Chavez expressed a preference for adopting a comprehensive plan, stating: "If we're willing to have comprehensive plans for every other topic in the city but not willing to do it for public safety, I think it sends a bad signal to our residents."

The committee will continue to work towards formal adoption or oversight of the plan.

### Community Safety Outreach Program Pilot

Julie Idelkope presented an overview of the Community Safety Outreach Program pilot, which provides living wage jobs for residents to improve community safety in their neighborhoods. The program operates through three partner organizations and focuses on training, mentorship, and community engagement.

Preliminary findings show strengths in providing high-quality employment and culturally competent service delivery. Challenges include sustainable funding, organizational capacity of partner organizations, and the need for better collaboration across different community safety programs.

The presentation was cut short due to time constraints, but committee members were encouraged to follow up with questions directly.
