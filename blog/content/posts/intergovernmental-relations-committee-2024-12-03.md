## Discussion

### Data Practices Amendment
Councilmember Chavez proposed removing language that would allow charging fees for public data requests. He argued that charging residents for public data would harm transparency. Some council members expressed concern about large data requests tying up staff resources, but supporters emphasized the importance of accessible public information. Councilmember Wonsley noted she had previously requested data about current practices and costs.

Quote from Councilmember Chavez: "I don't think we should charge residents fees for public data or data requests. I think we should strive to be transparent and not at-risk to prevent people from accessing information."

Passed 9-2 (Vetaw, Palmisano opposed)

### Group Home Licensing Amendment
Significant debate occurred around language regarding city inspection authority for group homes. The amendment would remove support for repealing state restrictions on city licensing of group homes. Some council members worried about safety oversight, while others cited concerns about discriminatory enforcement against disability communities. Council members requested more information about current inspection capabilities and League of Minnesota Cities positions before Thursday's full council meeting.

Quote from Councilmember Koski: "If we weren't able to be proactive as a city, there could be serious consequences for residents. And it's the safety of those residents that is top of mind for me."

Passed 8-3 (Vetaw, Palmisano, Rainville opposed)

### Prison Labor Amendment 
Councilmember Wonsley introduced an amendment supporting legislation to end sub-minimum wage prison labor. Discussion centered on current prison wages (reported as low as 14-25 cents per hour) and the broader implications of prison labor systems. Council President Payne connected the issue to selective law enforcement and systemic racism.

Quote from Council President Payne: "It's not just about the fairness of folks in jail who are forced to work. It's about eliminating this entire incentive to continue creating an ecosystem that keeps people at slave wages."

Passed 10-1 (Palmisano opposed)

### State Office of Violence Prevention
Final amendment supported establishing a state-level Office of Violence Prevention to coordinate regional strategies. Presented as way to better coordinate multi-jurisdictional public safety initiatives. 

Passed unanimously 11-0
