## Discussion

### Neighborhood Safety Department Management Update
Extensive discussion of departmental restructuring and improvements to violence prevention services. Deputy Director Lakes presented on staffing (9 filled positions, 6 in hiring, 2 not yet initiated), improved vendor support systems, and new data collection tools. Significant focus on strengthening contract oversight and improving invoice processing procedures. Council members expressed concerns about clarity in distinguishing between GVI, YGVI, and violence interruption programs, as well as deployment of resources to high-crime areas.

Council Member Vetaw noted: "I think this presentation makes GVI, YGVI and violence interruption sound like the same thing and it's not. It's two different initiatives... Where the questions come in at for me in Ward 4 is about the violence interrupters."

The department is implementing new support systems including regular office hours, drop-in sessions, and improved guidance materials for vendors. No formal vote required.

### Fire Department Recruitment Initiative
Council Member Koski presented a staff direction for policy review focused on increasing female representation in the fire department. The directive aims to examine barriers and identify solutions for recruitment and retention of female firefighters. Koski connected this to broader efforts around diversity and inclusion:

"The strength of our institutions at every level depends on ensuring that those who serve reflect the communities they protect. That is what this staff direction is about."

Passed as part of consent agenda (6-0).

### Worker's Compensation and Legal Settlements
Four worker's compensation claims and legal settlements were considered separately from other consent agenda items. These included claims from Mohammed Shahidullah, Ricardo Muro, Jonathan Petron, Michael Griffin, and Luis Porras. Limited discussion of specific cases.

Passed 4-2 (Chughtai and Wonsley voting no).
