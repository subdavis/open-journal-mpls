## Discussion

### SoundThinking Inc. Contract Postponement

The committee discussed postponing the vote on the SoundThinking Inc. contract for the gunshot location system (ShotSpotter). Commissioner Barnett explained that discussions were ongoing about the contract length, proposed expansion, and independent evaluation. The committee agreed to postpone the vote until September 9th to allow more time for negotiations with SoundThinking and to develop a modified proposal.

Vice Chair Palmisano expressed concern about the postponement, stating, "I feel strongly the length of the contract is right. It would allow us to collect data and conduct a more thorough review than any user has done before."

The motion to postpone passed with a vote of 4 ayes and 1 nay.

### Independent Evaluation of ShotSpotter Program

Chair Wonsley introduced a staff direction for an independent evaluation of the ShotSpotter program. The motion aims to support a full independent evaluation of the program's efficacy and alignment with best practices across the country. 

Council Member Vetaw questioned the need for this evaluation, stating, "I feel like all these questions were answered in the report that we got about ShotSpotter already."

Chair Wonsley responded, "What I heard from staff when they came and presented, they, too, need additional information and we've been in conversations amongst the committee for several months now about independent evaluation."

The motion passed with a vote of 4 ayes and 1 nay.

### Legislative Directive for ShotSpotter Analysis

Vice Chair Palmisano introduced a legislative directive requesting that the administration complete a thorough analysis of ShotSpotter technology. The directive includes examining how the technology is used, its fit within the comprehensive gun response strategy, and performance metrics.

The motion passed unanimously with 5 ayes.

### Performance Management and Innovation Department Progress

Director Megan Singleton presented an update on the Performance Management and Innovation department's progress. She discussed the Outcomes Minneapolis program, budget integration of performance metrics, and community safety pilots.

Council members expressed appreciation for the department's work on developing consistent performance metrics. Vice Chair Palmisano commented, "For the first time in a while, it feels good to hear back your depth of objective knowledge on these different topics!"

### Community Safety Pilots

Director Singleton provided details on three community safety pilots:

1. Embedded social workers in 911 MECC
2. Traffic control response to non-injury vehicle collisions
3. Community safety ambassadors

These pilots aim to enhance emergency response, reduce police workload, and improve community safety. Council members asked questions about implementation timelines, funding, and potential impacts on existing programs.
