## Discussion

### 2025 Budget Public Hearing
The committee held the second of three mandatory public hearings on Mayor Frey's recommended 2025 budget. The proposed budget totals $1.88 billion, representing a 2.86% increase from 2024, with an 8.1% property tax levy increase. The Board of Estimate and Taxation has authorized up to an 8.3% levy increase to provide additional funding for Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board programs.

### Labor Standards Board Debate
A significant portion of public comment focused on the proposed Labor Standards Board, with strong opinions both for and against. Business owners, particularly from the restaurant industry, expressed concerns about lack of clarity on funding and potential negative impacts on already struggling businesses. Labor advocates and workers supported the board as necessary protection against wage theft and workplace violations. No vote was taken as this was a hearing.

Quote from business owner Patricia Wall: "Instead of more bad policy and more regulations, what we should be talking about is the fact Minneapolis wants and needs thriving business, more jobs, and better public safety... Stop vilifying businesses and landlords. Most of us are just families trying to make a living, provide jobs to good people, and make Minneapolis a better place to live."

### Personnel Actions
The committee approved a 4% salary increase for approximately 650 appointed, non-represented and politically appointed employees, effective December 29, 2024. Total cost is $2.7 million. The committee also approved creation of two new appointed positions in the City Clerk's office - Chief Assistant City Clerk (Grade 16, $160,000-$190,000) and Director of Administration (Grade 15, $148,000-$176,000). Both passed unanimously by voice vote.
