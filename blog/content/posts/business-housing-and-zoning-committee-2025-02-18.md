## Discussion

### Native American Community Housing Project
The committee reviewed additional funding for an 83-unit affordable housing development at 1213 Franklin Avenue. The project includes expansion of the Native American Community Clinic and housing units ranging from 30-60% AMI with various rental assistance programs. Total development costs are expected to be $41.3M.

Council members expressed strong support for the project's focus on Native American community needs and affordable housing. Council Member Chowdhury noted: "Housing first practices are one of the best practices in order to provide stability for community members, especially community members struggling with homelessness."

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Rental License Revocation
The committee considered revoking the rental license for 1081 14th Avenue SE due to the owner's repeated failure to allow inspections despite multiple notices and citations. Staff confirmed that any current tenants would be eligible for relocation assistance. The committee expressed concern about tenant welfare while agreeing the owner's non-compliance warranted action.

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Food Vendor Operations and Regulations
Extensive presentation and discussion regarding food vendor licensing, regulations, and enforcement. Key topics included:
- State and local regulatory framework
- Current licensing options and locations
- Barriers for immigrant vendors
- Citations issued in 2023-24
- Cultural competency in enforcement

Council Member Chowdhury emphasized the need to help vendors achieve compliance rather than just enforce penalties: "If we stay at the status quo currently, we're going to continue to see every summer these food vendors at different locations... We're going to see concerns about food safety and foodborne illness."

The discussion highlighted ongoing work with community partners and the Parks Board to develop more accessible vending options while maintaining food safety standards.

Item was received and filed.
