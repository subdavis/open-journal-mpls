## Discussion

### Emergency Housing Vouchers
Major debate over $1.8M allocation to fund emergency housing vouchers in partnership with MPHA and Hennepin County. Council Member Wonsley argued this could house up to 30% of currently unsheltered residents with 97% success rate. Administration opposed funding sources, with COO Anderson-Kelliher offering to work on alternative funding:

>"This is not a great amendment because of the sources. It really damages other departments. And I guess coming with an olive branch to say we could work on a source together... there is a way forward."

Council divided on whether to pass immediately or wait for compromise. Passed 9-4.

### Behavioral Crisis Response Program Transfer
Discussion centered on moving BCR contract with Canopy Roots from Neighborhood Safety to Fire Department. Supporters argued it aligned better with emergency response services, while others worried about contract administration capacity. Commissioner Barnett noted:

>"I just think it's too early, that's all. We haven't planned it out."

Passed 11-1.

### Neighborhood Safety Initiatives 
Multiple amendments for specific neighborhoods sparked debate about targeted vs. citywide approach. Palmisano argued:

>"We can't build community safety ecosystem with all these ward and neighborhood specific projects that don't address community safety needs overall."

Others like Osman countered that some areas face disproportionate challenges:

>"We cannot be fair on resources, we have to be specific to the areas that are struggling."

Various initiatives passed with divided votes.

### Avivo Village Funding
Council Member Ellison proposed $1.6M to prevent closure of 100-bed shelter due to county funding cliff. While broadly supported, debate centered on city's role in shelter operations and process concerns. Palmisano noted:

>"We've got to stop this without thinking through the long-term plan for addressing the fiscal cliff that our partners are facing right now."

Passed 11-2.
