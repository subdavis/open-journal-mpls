## Discussion

### Mayor's Veto Override - 2025 Budget
The council successfully overrode Mayor Frey's veto of the 2025 budget with the minimum required nine votes. Significant debate occurred around budget priorities and process. Council Member Wonsley defended the council's amendments as necessary to address "pressing needs of working class residents." Council Member Palmisano criticized the process, arguing the only real reduction was "at the expense of denying cost of living increases to 161 city staff." Council Member Ellison called for better cooperation between council and mayor's office, noting "both sides of our government need to sort of look in the mirror and figure out how we're going to mitigate some of the fighting."

Vote: 9-4 to override veto

### Palestinian Rights Resolution Veto
The council failed to override the mayor's veto of a resolution expressing solidarity with campus activism supporting Palestinian rights. Council Member Wonsley expressed disappointment: "I'm sorry at this point in time that both the Mayor and some of my colleagues are still in the place where we can't see the tragic injustice being committed."

Vote: 7-6, failing to reach the 9 votes needed to override

### Police Critical Staffing Overtime Extension
Discussion centered around officer wellness concerns and policy reforms. Council President Payne shared new policy language from the Police Chief implementing restrictions on off-duty employment and requiring rest periods between shifts. Council Member Palmisano noted these shifts are "typically the most undesirable shifts, overnight shifts, that are difficult to fill in the first place."

Vote: 13-0 in favor
