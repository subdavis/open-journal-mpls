## Discussion

### Winter Safety for People Experiencing Homelessness
Comprehensive presentation on city's preparedness and response to severe weather impacts on unhoused residents. Emergency Management Director Sayre outlined best practices for community preparedness, emphasizing year-round planning over reactive responses. Hennepin County Housing Director Hewitt reported that of 3,866 people experiencing homelessness, approximately 496 are unsheltered, with about 150-200 living in encampments.

Council members expressed concern about shelter capacity issues. Chair Chavez referenced a recent Star Tribune article highlighting that "shelter beds are fully booked" and the county has "stopped tracking how many people it turned away."

Multiple departments outlined their roles, with Fire Chief Tyner discussing encampment safety inspections and emergency response procedures, and Regulatory Services describing outreach efforts.

The presentation concluded with planned improvements including enhanced communication systems and stronger community partnerships. Received and filed with no formal vote.

### Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign
Health Department presented new awareness campaign developed in partnership with trafficking survivors and local artists. Campaign features strategic placement of messages in bathroom stalls and public transit, using subtle imagery and symbolism to safely reach victims.

Beth Holger from The Link shared concerning statistics: 1.4% of 9th and 11th graders reported exchanging sexual activity for something of value, with higher rates among youth with substance use issues or disabilities.

Vice Chair Wonsley praised the survivor-centered approach: "Really grateful for you all bringing forward innovative and very strategic placement and being very intentional in the way in which you went about bringing it together and centering the expertise and lived experience."

Campaign materials include social media content, bus shelter ads, and 22 donated billboard spaces. Received and filed with no formal vote.
