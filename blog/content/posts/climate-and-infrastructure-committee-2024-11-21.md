### Climate Legacy Initiative Q3 Update
Patrick Hanlon presented a comprehensive update on the $10M annual Climate Legacy Initiative, showing significant progress across multiple programs. Key achievements included 400 residents engaged in workforce training, 412 green cost-share projects, and extensive community outreach. The program demonstrated strong focus on environmental justice communities, with most projects reaching BIPOC residents and environmental justice areas. Council members expressed strong support for the program's success while discussing potential future scaling.

> "When you look at the next five years, we're going to need some very aggressive actions in order to hit these aggressive targets and ambitious targets." - Patrick Hanlon

Vote: Report received and filed

### Gas Franchise Extension
The committee approved extending the current gas franchise ordinance with CenterPoint Energy through April 2024 to allow time for complete negotiation of a new agreement. This aligns with the recently approved Xcel franchise timeline. The item received no public comments or significant council discussion.

Vote: Passed unanimously

### 38th/Chicago Concept Layout
The most debated item of the meeting involved the concept layout for the reconstruction of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue at George Floyd Square. Public Works presented a "flexible" design option that would allow for both regular traffic flow and temporary closures for gatherings and events. Council Member Chavez expressed strong opposition to the plan, arguing it didn't adequately address community needs:

> "The reality is, that we would not have to be in this situation if we transformed our police department. If we would have invested in a 38th Street plan years ago. Instead now we're talking about 'It's time to move forward for some but not everyone.'"

Council Member Jenkins provided historical context about the intersection's significance and transformation over the past 20 years.

Vote: Moved forward to full Council without recommendation

### Boulevard Ordinance Postponement 
Discussion arose around postponing the boulevard ordinance to January 23rd to allow more time for technical guidance development regarding permitting procedures for boulevard gardens. Councilmember Vetaw opposed the delay, questioning the necessity of additional time. Councilmember Chowdhury supported the postponement to ensure proper implementation.

Vote: Passed with Councilmember Vetaw voting no on the postponement

## Public Comments
No members of the public provided comments during the meeting.
