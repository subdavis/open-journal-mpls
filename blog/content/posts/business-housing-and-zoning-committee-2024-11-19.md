Passed unanimously.

The shelter operator, Kellie Martin, addressed these concerns by outlining security measures, clinical support, and housing placement services. Councilmember Ellison facilitated dialogue between the operator and concerned neighbor, emphasizing the importance of both addressing homelessness and maintaining neighborhood safety. Passed unanimously.
