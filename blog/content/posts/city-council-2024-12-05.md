## Discussion

### Labor Standards Board Resolution Veto Override
The council attempted to override Mayor Frey's veto of the Labor Standards Board resolution. The mayor offered a compromise proposal giving 50% of seats to business representatives and 50% to worker representatives, requiring a 2/3 majority for recommendations. Several council members expressed concern this would effectively give business interests veto power. The override failed with 8 votes in favor and 5 against (9 votes needed).

### George Floyd Square Design
Extensive debate over the future design of George Floyd Square. Councilmember Chavez proposed pursuing a pedestrian mall concept instead of the city's flexible design option. This sparked debate about delaying the project versus moving forward with current plans. Public Works Director indicated pursuing pedestrian mall would delay construction beyond 2025.

Quote from Councilmember Jenkins: "The resolution as it is stated clearly is a delay...It would take years of community engagement, of designing a pedestrian mall. So it is a delay. There is no two ways."

Motion to refer back to committee and approve resolution passed 8-5.

### Campus Protest Solidarity Resolution 
Heated debate over resolution supporting student protesters at University of Minnesota. Councilmember Palmisano opposed, citing property damage and intimidation. Councilmember Wonsley defended protesters, arguing against criminalization of protest. Resolution passed 7-6.

Quote from Councilmember Wonsley: "I don't believe City Council should be in the business of criminalizing protests...I've been consistent in that position both while being on this body and even prior to joining this Council."

### Appointed Employee Salary Schedule
Discussion of cost-of-living adjustments for appointed employees. Several council members expressed concern about raises for highest-paid positions (up to $390,000) during budget constraints. Item 2.1 was continued to next meeting to explore targeted increases for lower-paid positions while potentially freezing top salaries. Remaining salary items passed unanimously.

### Reproductive Healthcare Facility Access 
Following closed session on Pro-Life Action Ministries litigation, council unanimously passed amendment to clinic access ordinance adding exceptions for legally protected conduct while maintaining protections for healthcare access.
