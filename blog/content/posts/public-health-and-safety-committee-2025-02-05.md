## Discussion

### REACH Grant Update
The Health Department presented on the implementation of their $5M CDC REACH grant focused on improving health outcomes for Black, African-American, and Native American communities. The program works on nutrition access, physical activity, breastfeeding support, and vaccination access. First-year accomplishments included partnering with hospitals on food service guidelines, implementing produce prescription programs, and supporting community-based vaccination efforts. Council members expressed concern about potential federal funding reductions but praised the program's community-focused approach.

Vote: Received and filed unanimously

### Navigation Center Report
CPED Director Hansen presented an analysis of the 2018-2019 Navigation Center experience and potential sites for a new facility. The original center cost approximately $3M to operate for 9 months and served up to 160 people, with 68 "positive exits" to housing. Three potential city-owned sites were evaluated but each presented significant challenges. Council members debated the effectiveness of the model, with some questioning the cost-per-person ($66,000) while others emphasized the urgent need for emergency shelter options.

Quote from Council Member Ellison: "While we learned all of that, I don't know that we put all those learnings to use. I don't know that we've necessarily been in the best position to build on those learnings at a systemic level."

Vote: Received and filed unanimously

### Drug Overdose Prevention Strategies
The City Auditor's office presented research on other cities' approaches to overdose prevention, including harm reduction vending machines ($2,500-$15,000 per unit) and specialized response teams. The report highlighted successful programs combining immediate intervention with longer-term support services. Council members expressed interest in expanding Minneapolis's existing naloxone vending machine pilot program and potentially creating dedicated overdose response teams within emergency services.

Vote: Received and filed unanimously
