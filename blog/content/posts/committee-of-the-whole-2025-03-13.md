## Discussion

### DOJ Settlement Updates Walk-On Item
Council Member Wonsley introduced a motion to amend an existing legislative directive to require monthly (rather than quarterly) updates on DOJ proceedings. She emphasized the need for more frequent updates due to ongoing changes in the situation. The amendment was specifically focused on litigation-related matters.

Quote from CM Wonsley: "This would just make sure that we're getting responsive and timely updates on this because we've seen there's been lots of shifts with it, and so we can act accordingly."

Vote: Passed by voice vote unanimously

### Closed Session Litigation
Three separate litigation matters were discussed in closed session. Upon return to open session, the clerk reported that no actions were taken regarding the DOJ case or the San Francisco v. Trump case. However, following the closed session, the council approved a $45,000 settlement for the Pro-Life Action Ministries case, to be paid to the plaintiff's attorneys, Thomas Moore Society.

Vote: Passed by voice vote unanimously

### Committee Reports
Extensive committee reports were presented from all standing committees, including significant infrastructure projects, public health initiatives, and urban development matters. Notable items included a biochar facility construction bid, Hennepin Avenue South street project amendments, and various transportation safety improvements. Each committee chair presented their items and stood for questions, though no significant discussion or debate was recorded.
