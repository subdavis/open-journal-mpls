## Discussion

### Clean Energy Partnership Annual Report
The committee received a detailed presentation on the 2023 Clean Energy Partnership Annual Report. Key findings showed the city is not on track for most climate goals, with particular concerns about natural gas emissions. The city has achieved a 34% reduction in emissions since 2006, but projections show the city will exceed its carbon budget by 2034 if current trends continue.

Luke Hollencamp explained: "If you imagine a trendline coming out from our baseline year through 2023, in the not so distant future, the trend line will actually exceed the emissions reduction targets we have set for the city and the Climate Equity Plan."

The report highlighted success in municipal operations (64% emissions reduction) but showed challenges in residential (32% reduction) and commercial sectors. Natural gas usage remains a significant obstacle, with only a 1% reduction in gas emissions since baseline.

### Municipal Solar Installation Barriers
Discussion revealed several challenges in implementing solar on city buildings. An initial RFP for large-scale installation across multiple buildings faced structural limitations and cost barriers. The city has shifted to a site-by-site approach, with particular focus on the water plant site. The city has achieved 97% renewable electricity for municipal operations primarily through subscription programs rather than on-site installation.

### EVAC Input and Franchise Agreements
Patty O'Keefe from EVAC provided feedback emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate goals, particularly regarding fossil gas emissions. She stressed the importance of using the upcoming franchise agreement negotiations as leverage for stronger commitments from utility partners. 

Councilmember Chowdhury noted: "This is our accountability metric. And it just really shows, again, like, there is a lot of work to be done. And the urgency needs to be there."

The committee announced that draft franchise agreements will be made public next week, with a hearing scheduled for January 23rd.

Vote on consent agenda: Passed unanimously (4-0)
