## Discussion

### 4D Affordable Housing Program Changes
Staff proposed reducing rent and income restrictions from 60% AMI to 50% AMI for studios and one-bedrooms, while maintaining 60% AMI for larger units. The program has seen dramatic growth, with enrollment increasing six-fold in 2023. Consultant analysis showed most enrolled properties already charge rents below both thresholds, suggesting the city is providing tax benefits without gaining additional affordability.

Industry representatives argued against the changes, with Steven Mihn noting "This program is your most successful affordable housing program" and warning that lowering thresholds would reduce participation. Council members debated between acting now or waiting for more data, with Councilmember Ellison noting concerns about exponential growth in the program affecting the tax base.

The committee ultimately voted 5-1 to forward without recommendation to allow for further discussion at full council.

### Billboard Sign Credits Appeal
Orange Barrel Media appealed a zoning administrator decision requiring sign credits for billboard replacements. The company argued they had relied on initial city approval and that requiring credits for replacement of existing billboards exceeded city authority. Clear Channel Outdoor countered that Orange Barrel had no rights to the nonconforming use status of the previous billboards.

The committee sided with staff's interpretation that credits were required under city ordinance. As Councilmember Ellison noted, "We have to enforce the ordinance. It's not anything I feel we can take into consideration at this point."

Vote: Unanimous to deny the appeal.

### Unlawful Home Occupations Enforcement
Staff presented findings on enforcement challenges regarding illegal auto repair, scrapping, and dumping. Key issues included limited inspector availability, safety concerns, and difficulty catching violations in real-time. Council Member Vetaw, who initiated the study, focused particularly on illegal dumping issues in North Minneapolis.

Director Enrique announced plans to work with first-ring suburbs on reciprocal enforcement: "If we encounter issues where we find residents, property owners, business owners dumping in Minneapolis properties, we will go to the cities and allow them to go after their own residents and their own businesses."

No vote taken - received and filed.

### Neighborhood Commercial Uses Study
CPED presented findings on allowing more retail in residential areas. While some desire exists for neighborhood-serving retail, staff noted significant barriers including building code requirements, market demand issues, and enforcement concerns. The presentation recommended further study and engagement during the next comprehensive plan update.

No vote taken - received and filed.
