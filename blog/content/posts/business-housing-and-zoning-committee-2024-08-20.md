## Discussion

### High 5 Tobacco Business License

Council Member Cashman requested to delay voting on the High 5 Tobacco business license application for three weeks to allow for a community meeting. Concerns were raised about the property's history of loitering, drug use, and other criminal activity. The license application includes 11 proposed conditions to address safety concerns. Council Member Cashman emphasized the importance of community input:

> "I'll be motioning to delay this one cycle, which is three weeks before our next BHZ meeting. The purpose of that motion is to allow for us to schedule a community meeting with many neighbors that live in this area as well as other business owners, and to talk through how all of us can contribute to the enforcement of these conditions and really work together on proactive safety approaches here."

The motion to delay passed unanimously.

### Minneapolis Employment and Training Program

Deb Bahr-Helgen and Mark Brinda presented on the Minneapolis Employment and Training Program. They highlighted labor market trends, including low unemployment rates and increasing labor force participation among BIPOC residents. The program serves about 10,500 residents annually with a budget of $11-12.5 million. Key initiatives include apprenticeships, green career pathways, and skills-based hiring practices. 

Council Member Jenkins raised concerns about the lack of specific programs for LGBTQ youth:

> "I've been really trying to advocate and promote programs for LGBTQ youth. And I still don't see those kinds of opportunities directly included...I would still like to see a program that is directed specifically at those communities that don't always have the same opportunities."

No vote was taken on this informational item.

### Commercial to Residential Building Conversions

Evan Davis from the University of Minnesota presented research on adaptive reuse of commercial buildings for residential purposes. The report examined case studies from Denver, Cleveland, and Chicago, highlighting strategies like regulatory changes, financial incentives, and interdepartmental coordination. 

Council Member Cashman noted upcoming code amendments to facilitate these conversions:

> "Council Member Rainville and I are authoring and working with CPED Director Meg McMahan, Planning Director, and Eric Hanson on some code amendments that will be coming before council next week. We see this as a step one."

No vote was taken on this informational item.

### Garage Expansion Variance Appeal

The committee heard an appeal of a Board of Adjustment decision denying variances for a garage expansion at 3505 Irving Avenue South. The project would increase the floor area ratio and impervious surface coverage beyond allowed limits. The appellant argued the expansion was minimal and in line with other properties in the area. 

Council Member Rainville moved to grant the appeal:

"I think that investing in our city is just like the businesses that were here and are investing. This is a resident that's investing. It's going to add to the liveability."

Council Member Chowdhury opposed:

"I don't think I'm going to be able to support the appeal today. Primarily due to the impervious surface requirements that we have...As we increase impervious surface city wide, it has impacts around urban heat island impact, erosion, the treatment of our water."

The appeal was granted in a 3-2 vote.

## Public Comments

Barb from Elliott Park (Ward 6) commented on the need for funding to address drug dealing and safety issues in her neighborhood:

"My interest as a resident is that the improved neighborhood conditions part, we have a severe drug dealing and evidently drug-making problem on 11th Avenue as evidenced by the explosion of the building the other night at 1501 11th Avenue South. The building I live in is vulnerable adults and seniors, and this behavior is happening 60 feet from the door of one of our buildings."

She requested funding for off-duty police patrols and other creative safety approaches. Council Member Osman thanked her for highlighting the challenges in Elliott Park and promised to pay more attention to the area's needs.
