## Discussion

### MPD Vacation Accrual Extension
Discussion centered around extending maximum vacation accrual from 400 to 550 hours through 2025 for MPD officers. Currently 105 officers across three bargaining units are at risk of losing accrued vacation hours. Questions were raised about budgetary impacts and why this wasn't addressed in recent contract negotiations. Chief O'Hara explained staffing shortages make it difficult for officers to use vacation time.

Quote from Assistant Chief Blackwell: "We're asking for one-year extension...Our hiring has gotten a lot better. It's getting a lot better in 2025, for more relief for our officers."

Forwarded without recommendation in a 6-0 vote.

### MPD Critical Staffing Overtime Extension 
Extended discussion about continuing critical staffing overtime through 2025. Chief O'Hara described severe staffing shortages with only 519 active duty officers out of 577 total sworn positions. Concerns raised about officer fatigue and wellness. Questions about tracking overtime hours and defining "critical" staffing needs.

Quote from Chief O'Hara: "The reality is, all of them are overworked. They're all tired. They're all exhausted. At the same time, I cannot allow a shift to go out with no cops."

Forwarded without recommendation in a 6-0 vote.
