## Discussion

### Resolution on Rethinking I-94 Project

Council Member Osman introduced a resolution expressing the city's priorities for the Minnesota Department of Transportation's Rethinking I-94 project. The resolution, authored by Council Members Wonsley, Osman, and Cashman, aims to ensure that the state respects city priorities and listens to the community before moving forward with the project. 

Osman emphasized the importance of reconnecting communities that have historically been targeted by state planning projects. He stated, "Reconnecting communities is the most important thing for our communities, and I stand behind this."

The resolution passed unanimously.

### Blue Line Light Rail Extension Preliminary Design Plans

The committee held a public hearing on the preliminary design plans for the Blue Line Light Rail Extension. City staff presented an overview of the project, highlighting its potential benefits and addressing concerns about displacement and community impact.

Key points from the staff presentation:

- The project is a billion-dollar-plus investment that will bring fast, reliable transit service to North Loop and North Minneapolis.
- It includes five planned transit stations, with the city requesting a sixth station.
- The project aims to help achieve mode shift, greenhouse gas reduction, and equity goals.
- Concerns about displacement and community impact were acknowledged, with staff emphasizing the importance of anti-displacement strategies.

Council Member Ellison commented on the challenges of balancing the need for improved infrastructure with the potential for displacement:

"We're tasked with a really difficult challenge here. Right. On one hand, we know that ridership of public trans is the highest in North Minneapolis. And yet, we don't have state of the art infrastructure. What good is the best infrastructure if it displaces you. You can't use it. We preserve the infrastructure but not at the expense of our neighborhood and culture. That's what we're trying to square."

No vote was taken on this item, as it was a public hearing. Further discussion and action will take place in future meetings.

8. Candy Bacon, a Heritage Park resident, expressed support for the project as an opportunity for the future, emphasizing the need to ensure all voices are heard and respected in the process.
