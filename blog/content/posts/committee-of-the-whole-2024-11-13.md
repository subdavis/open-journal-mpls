## Discussion

### George Floyd Square Reconstruction Project
The committee discussed various options for the street reconstruction at George Floyd Square, including pedestrian-only, pedestrian-transit only, and flexible open street options. Director Anderson Kelliher explained that while there was initial interest in a pedestrian plaza, business access requirements and community feedback led to considering more flexible options. The project has involved 25,000 community interactions and engagement with 15 local businesses.

Council Member Cashman expressed concern about the terminology: "There's, like, a little bit of a cognitive dissonance I'm seeing the open street option with the cars when we have all these open streets and the definition of 'open' is pedestrian only."

The discussion revealed that the last reconstruction of this area was in 1958/1959, making this project significantly overdue.

### The People's Way Development
Director Eric Hansen explained the guardrails in place to ensure community-led development of the People's Way. Key requirements include:
- The community partner must be a nonprofit
- Using a Request for Qualifications rather than Request for Proposals to maintain community input
- Partnership approach with staff, elected officials, and community in decision-making

### Council Tracking Report
City Clerk Casey Karl presented a comprehensive report showing:
- 48 ordinances introduced in first seven months of 2023
- 70% of legislative proposals actively being developed
- Strong collaboration between Council and Administration
- 1,170 total Council actions taken in 2023
- Quarterly reporting structure established for future tracking

Karl emphasized: "There is a false narrative that the City is not working... The data shown in these reports proves otherwise."
