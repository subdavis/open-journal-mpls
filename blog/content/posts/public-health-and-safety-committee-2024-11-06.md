## Discussion

### Presidential Election Impact
Vice Chair Wonsley opened with remarks about the previous night's presidential election results, expressing concern about potential federal policy changes affecting marginalized communities. She emphasized the importance of cities as "front line of defense" for protecting residents' needs and rights, particularly given likely federal funding cuts to public health, labor rights, and environmental justice programs.

### Labor Standards Board Resolution
Extended debate over the creation of a new Labor Standards Board. The proposal would establish a 15-member advisory board with equal representation from employers, employees, and community stakeholders. Key points of contention included:

- Process concerns about lack of public hearing
- Questions about board composition and balance
- Debate over implementation timeline and resources needed

Councilmember Palmisano moved to delay for additional public input, stating: "Local business owners are downright fearful. And I've been contacted by literally dozens of Minneapolis business owners."

The motion to delay failed 2-4. The main resolution passed 4-2.

### 340B Drug Pricing Program Analysis
Presentation on analysis of hospital participation in federal drug discount program. Discussion focused on lack of transparency in how hospitals use program savings and limited oversight of benefits to low-income patients. Council President Payne noted: "It seems very disturbing to me [...] that covered entities can sell at any price they want with zero transparency or accountability to what their profit margin is."

No formal vote required - report received and filed.

### South Minneapolis Community Safety Center
Director Harrington provided updates on the Lake Street Safety Center opening and progress on the larger South Minneapolis facility. Timeline for the latter project was adjusted to 2026 opening, later than initially planned. Discussion focused on ensuring coordinated opening of both police and non-police services in the facility.

Report received and filed.

## Public Comments
No members of the public spoke during designated public comment periods, though there were observers present for the Labor Standards Board discussion who were acknowledged but did not have formal speaking opportunity.
