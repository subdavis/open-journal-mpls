## Discussion

### Sexual Assault Victim Advocacy Services

The advocates provide confidential support, hospital accompaniment, and coordination with the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. The presentation highlighted the critical role these advocates play in supporting survivors throughout the justice process.
Passed unanimously by voice vote.

### REIB Department Update

The presentation focused on behavioral transformation and systems change approaches to advancing racial equity. Council members expressed interest in evaluation metrics and the need for both data collection and meaningful community engagement.
Received and filed.

### Cure Violence Global Contract
Deputy Director Lakes presented a detailed overview of the $161,000 three-year contract for technical assistance in violence prevention. The discussion revealed tensions between data-driven deployment decisions and community needs. Councilmember Ellison notably expressed concerns about over-emphasis on data collection:

>"I think if you demand busy work, you'll get sort of shallow results... if you value the substance of that, then you'll get substance in return."

Several council members questioned the balance between accountability and maintaining trust with community partners.
Passed with 6 ayes.

### Minneapolis Strategic Outreach Contracts
This item was withdrawn from the agenda with significant controversy. Councilmember Osman strongly objected to the removal of services from Cedar Riverside:

>"We have seen the change... we have seen great things from local inspectors, the chief, and everyone talking about especially the most important thing, the community businesses that the importance effect it had in the communities."

The administration declined to provide detailed explanations for the changes, citing pending review. Motion to refer back to staff passed 4-2.

### Closed Session
The committee entered closed session to discuss police union negotiation strategy. No public details available about the discussion.

## Public Comments
No formal public comment period occurred during this meeting, though community members from Cedar Riverside were present for the discussion of violence prevention services.
