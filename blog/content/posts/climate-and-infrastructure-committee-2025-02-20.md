### Farview North Residential Resurfacing Project
The project involves resurfacing local streets bounded by Third Street North to Dupont Avenue North and 26th Avenue North to Lowry Avenue North. The total assessment amount is $846,767.42. Several residents expressed concerns about the financial burden of the assessments, particularly for elderly and low-income residents. Public Works staff explained payment options including a 5-year payment plan and deferment options for seniors and disabled residents. Despite public concerns, the committee approved the assessments.

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Biochar Production Partnership
The city presented a partnership with Xcel Energy to receive utility line maintenance vegetation for Minneapolis biochar production. The program will convert 3,000 tons of wood waste into 500 tons of biochar, removing equivalent of 3,600 tons of carbon dioxide. The facility will be located in the Innovation District near Huntington Bank Stadium. Committee members expressed enthusiasm for the program's environmental benefits and community engagement aspects.

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Rethinking I-94 Project
MnDOT presented updates on the I-94 corridor project between downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul. The presentation sparked significant debate about traffic patterns, environmental impact, and community needs. Committee members, particularly Chair Cashman and Councilmember Chowdhury, questioned MnDOT's dismissal of at-grade alternatives and emphasized the city's goals for reducing vehicle miles traveled and increasing transit usage.

Chair Cashman noted: "For me, it feels like slowing down traffic, reducing vehicle miles traveled, having safe transit options is a priority."

No vote required - discussion only
