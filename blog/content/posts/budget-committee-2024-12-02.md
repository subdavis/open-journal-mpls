## Discussion

### Appointed Employee Salary Increases
The committee debated a 4% salary increase for appointed employees. Several council members expressed concerns about approving raises for higher-paid positions during budget constraints. Councilmember Chowdhury noted this could save $1 million that could be redirected to other priorities. Councilmember Rainville opposed, stating "it seems vindictive and we're focusing on these people. I don't like that message at all."

Quote from Councilmember Palmisano during subsequent discussion: "We voted on items on this agenda today, and some of us had information that this will be used as a source for a budget amendment on Friday or on Monday, and others didn't have that information."

Vote: 8 ayes, 4 nays (Denied)

### Deputy Commissioner of Community Safety Position
Commissioner Barnett presented the case for creating a new Deputy Commissioner position with a salary range of $182,000-$215,000. He emphasized the role would help manage settlement agreement compliance and implementation of the Safe and Thriving Community Report. Councilmember Wonsley opposed, suggesting the funds would be better spent on additional staff under Director Harrington. Councilmember Rainville supported, citing the need for help with county and state coordination on public safety issues.

Vote: 10 ayes, 2 nays (Approved)

### Third Quarter Financial Report
The Finance Department presented the Q3 financial status report highlighting several key issues:
- Property tax revenue is $21M under budget
- Parking revenue is rebounding but still below target
- City maintains AAA bond rating
- General Fund balance projected at $170M (21.5% of expenditures)

Discussion focused on implications of downtown property value decreases and parking revenue trends.
