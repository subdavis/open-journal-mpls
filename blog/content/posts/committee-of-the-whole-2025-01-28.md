## Discussion

### Emergency Funding for Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center
Vice President Chowdhury presented a proposal for emergency funding to sustain a warming center that opened during recent cold weather. The center has provided critical services since January 6th, helping 15 residents enter treatment, 18 enter long-term shelter, and 2 secure permanent housing. Hennepin County has already contributed $100,000, though the total needed is over $300,000. 

Councilmember Osman emphasized the center's importance: "This is a place that folks were coming in and getting the services... This place is what we need in our city of Minneapolis."

The motion passed unanimously with 12 votes in favor.

### Civil Unrest After Action Review
Chair Chavez moved to refer the 2020 Civil Unrest After Action Review Final Report back to staff after multiple postponements. The motion passed by voice vote without discussion.

### Winter Safety and Emergency Preparedness
Chair Chavez announced that the report back date would be moved from February 5th to February 19th to accommodate staff needs. This will be formally amended at the full Council meeting.
