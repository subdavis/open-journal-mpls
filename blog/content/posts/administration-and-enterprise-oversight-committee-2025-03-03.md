### Urban Scholars Program Updates

The program has received over 1,250 applications for 2025, exceeding last year's pace. The program will support 8-10 internal scholars and approximately 45 total positions including external partners. Council members expressed strong interest in the program's expansion and departmental participation.

Councilmember Cashman inquired about legislative department participation and expressed interest in hosting an intern. The program will run June 2nd through August, with placements finalized within the next month and a half.

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Zencity Community Perception Survey
Extensive discussion occurred regarding the methodology and preliminary findings of Zencity's community perception survey of MPD. The survey measures trust, fairness, safety, and procedural justice metrics across precincts. Council members raised concerns about data transparency, geographic representation, and alignment with consent decree requirements.

Chair Wonsley questioned the baseline metrics and suggested incorporating pre-2020 data: "I want to get a sense of where our community perceptions of MPD, in particular, and using a baseline of 2020, May 2020... maybe, also, pre-May 2020 to now also be able to assess to where you are focusing."

Councilmember Vetaw, initially skeptical, expressed support: "This information has been good in guiding us for what we need to focus our public safety efforts on... I'm excited to know what action we can take in the future based off this data."

Key concerns included data privacy, AI usage in analysis, and public accessibility of findings. MPD committed to working on making the data more publicly accessible.

Vote: Received and filed unanimously
