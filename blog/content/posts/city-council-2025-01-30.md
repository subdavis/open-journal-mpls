## Discussion

### Emergency Warming Center Funding
The council approved emergency funding for Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center (MIWRC) to operate a warming center. Council Member Chowdhury emphasized this was a critical life-saving measure during extreme cold, while acknowledging it was a reactive rather than strategic response to homelessness. Council members praised MIWRC for stepping up when other facilities were at capacity. Several members emphasized the need for better cross-jurisdictional coordination on homelessness response.

Council Member Ellison noted: "If we take that attitude, I think we're going to just engage in this dollars for dollars standoff. Nobody is going to invest. People are going to lose their ability to stay secure."

Passed unanimously (13-0)

### Police Off-Duty Fee Ordinance
The council passed an ordinance enabling the city to collect fees for police off-duty work. The measure allows the city to begin charging for use of squad cars and other city resources when officers work private security jobs. Council Member Wonsley emphasized this was about good governance and fiscal responsibility, noting the city could have recouped up to $1.4 million if fees had been implemented earlier.

Some council members expressed concerns about who would pay the fees and impact on community events. Council Member Jenkins worried about passing the ordinance before knowing exact fee amounts, while Council Member Ellison praised returning to "boring, deliberative" governance around police issues.

Passed 12-0 (Jenkins absent for vote)

### George Floyd Square Development Debate
Two competing paths forward emerged regarding the intersection where George Floyd was murdered. Council Member Cashman introduced an ordinance to create a pedestrian mall, while Council Member Jenkins gave notice to discharge the current reconstruction plan from committee. Jenkins strongly opposed the pedestrian mall concept, arguing it would harm transit access for her constituents, noting "The number 5 is a route that runs through six different communities... It is a major thoroughfare in the city of Minneapolis and the region."

Council Member Chavez countered that the council had previously voted to support a pedestrian concept plan. The clerk provided detailed procedural guidance on how to handle the competing proposals.

No votes taken - matter continues in committee

### Patricia Day Settlement
Following a closed session, the council approved a $600,000 settlement in the case of Patricia Day v. City of Minneapolis. The settlement will be paid in two checks: $175,000 to Patricia Day and $425,000 to Robins LLP. Council Member Palmisano recused herself due to a previous working relationship with the plaintiff.

Passed 10-0 (Osman, Jenkins, Palmisano absent)
