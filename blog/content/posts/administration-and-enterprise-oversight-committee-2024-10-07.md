## Discussion

### Black Business Enterprise Contract

The committee discussed a proposed $1 million contract with Black Business Enterprise for capacity building and compliance consulting services for the Neighborhood Safety Department. Council members expressed concerns about the organization's capacity to handle such a large contract, given their small size and limited public information. 

Director Nelson-Brown explained that the contract was chosen through an RFP process and would provide support to violence prevention contractors. However, council members felt they needed more information before approving such a large contract.

Council Member Ellison stated: "If we're going to spend a million dollars, everything might be fine. I just, like, as a council member, you mentioned you can see how it can look problematic sitting from where we're sitting here. Yeah. We have to vote on it. It can't look problematic to us. It has to look thorough to us."

The committee voted unanimously to delay the item for one cycle to allow for more individual conversations with the director.

### Metro Youth Diversion Center Contract

The committee approved a contract with Metro Youth Diversion Center for violence interruption outreach services under the MinneapolUS program. This contract was specifically for the PK Initiative in Council Member Osman's ward, targeting culturally specific needs in that area.

Council members expressed support for the contract but also encouraged similar engagement with other council members to address needs in their wards. The contract was approved by voice vote.

### South Minneapolis Community Safety Center Design Contract

The committee approved a contract with Wold Architects and Engineers for design services for the South Minneapolis Community Safety Center, not to exceed $998,000. The contract covers all phases from pre-design to construction administration.

Jared from the Office of Community Safety presented the services and resources identified for the center through community engagement, including 311 services, community navigators, domestic violence services, mental health services, police, and youth services.

The contract was approved by voice vote.

### Fees for Police Off-Duty Work

Chair Wonsley introduced items related to implementing fees for police off-duty work and regulating the off-duty system. She explained that the current system allows officers to use city resources for private security work without adequate compensation to the city.

Vice Chair Palmisano expressed support for the concept but suggested a more comprehensive approach: "I would rather attack off-duty work straight on. Who would administer the kinds of costs? There could be so many one-offs for different situations. I would rather bring the entire entity in house."

The items related to fees for off-duty work were approved by roll call vote, with 5 ayes and 1 nay.
