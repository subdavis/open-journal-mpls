## Discussion

### Walker Art Center Amplified Sound Permit Extension

Council Member Cashman presented a request from the Walker Art Center to extend their amplified sound permit for the Avant Garden Gala 2024 event until midnight, two hours beyond the normally permitted time. Cashman highlighted the importance of the event, which is expected to raise $750,000 to $1 million and attract close to 2,000 attendees. The Walker has implemented measures to minimize noise disruption, including sound-absorbing drapery and conducting their own sound testing.

The City Attorney clarified that the extension does not violate state law, correcting a typo in the agenda and RCA. 

Vice Chair Chowdhury seconded the motion, expressing gratitude to Cashman's office and acknowledging the Walker Art Center's contributions to the arts and culture community.

The motion passed unanimously.

### Potential Roof Depot Site and Urban Farm Project Proposal

Chair Chavez announced that work is ongoing to bring forward a proposal related to the Roof Depot site and the Urban Farm Project for the full Council meeting on Thursday. He mentioned that meetings are still taking place between residents and CPED (Community Planning and Economic Development). Chavez emphasized that the item currently in LIMS (Legislative Information Management System) is not the final action for full Council consideration.

Council Member Palmisano requested more information about the potential proposal. Chavez explained that they are working to keep the community project alive and collaborate with the state legislature, but details are not yet finalized.

No vote was taken on this item as it was an informational update.
