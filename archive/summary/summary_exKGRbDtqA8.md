## Discussion

### Nomination of Rachel Sayre as Emergency Management Director

Mayor Frey introduced Rachel Sayre as his nominee for the position of Emergency Management Director. He highlighted her extensive experience in international humanitarian aid and disaster response, including work with U.S. Aid in various global crises. Council members asked questions about Sayre's approach to emergency management, language access, and considerations for vulnerable communities during crises.

Sayre addressed the committee, emphasizing her background in emergency response and her commitment to making Minneapolis a leader in emergency preparedness. She highlighted her experience with the National Incident Management System and her focus on addressing the needs of the most affected people during emergencies.

Council members expressed support for the nomination, with several emphasizing the importance of language access and considering vulnerable populations in emergency planning.

The nomination was approved unanimously.

### Encampment Removal Reporting Ordinance

Council Members Chowdhury, Chughtai, and Chavez presented an ordinance requiring regular reporting on encampment removals, including costs, outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness, and public safety data. The ordinance aims to increase transparency and accountability in the city's approach to encampments.

The discussion was lengthy and contentious, with council members and public commenters expressing a range of views. Supporters argued that the ordinance would provide necessary data to inform better policy decisions, while opponents raised concerns about potential delays in encampment closures and the scope of data collection.

Council Member Palmisano proposed an amendment to remove certain reporting requirements related to housing and services, arguing that these were outside the city's jurisdiction. This amendment was debated but ultimately failed.

Council Member Ellison said: "This really is about transparency in spending. I do want to be, I know some folks might be upset because their experience with staff can be a traumatic one. Their experience with the system can be a traumatic one. But I really do view this as a systemic problem not an individual problem."

The ordinance passed with a vote of 4 ayes and 2 nays.
