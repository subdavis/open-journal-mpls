## Discussion

### Off-Duty Police Resource Fee Ordinance
Extensive discussion centered on establishing fees for city resources used during off-duty police work. Vice Chair Wonsley presented the ordinance as culmination of three years of work, noting potential revenue of $1.4 million if fees had been in place previously. The ordinance would enable the city to collect fees for equipment and resources used during off-duty assignments.

Council members raised concerns about tracking mechanisms and impact on public safety response. Council Member Rainville questioned the potential effect on hiring off-duty officers, while Council Member Palmisano sought clarification on fee proration when officers respond to emergencies during off-duty assignments.

Council President Payne supported the measure, noting concerns about officer wellness and staffing levels: "Either we have a staffing shortage and we're at critical staffing levels, or we have enough capacity to flex in to some of these optional overtime areas whether off duty or buy back."

Passed unanimously (6-0).

### Winter Safety Plans and Homeless Services
Chair Chavez introduced a walk-on item directing the administration to prepare a presentation on winter safety plans and emergency preparedness, particularly focusing on services for people experiencing homelessness. The directive seeks information about jurisdictional services and emergency response plans during extreme weather conditions.

Council President Payne noted that current emergency operations plans from 2016 are outdated and don't address the current scale of needs. Council Member Rainville emphasized the complexity of the issue and suggested solving the problem first and billing other government agencies later.

Passed unanimously by voice vote.
