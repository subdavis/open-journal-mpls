## Discussion

### 2025 License Fee Schedule Amendments

Council Member Wonsley proposed two amendments to the 2025 license fee schedule. The first reduced fees for transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Lyft from $36,000 to $12,500. The second added new pollution control annual registration (PCAR) fees for carbon dioxide emissions.

The TNC fee reduction was generally supported, but the new pollution fee sparked debate. Some council members argued it was premature to add the fee before a program was in place to administer it. City Attorney Anderson stated, "First we have to get the FTE. Which the budget process is not over."

Council Member Wonsley defended the amendments, saying extensive work had been done with staff to justify the fees: "As I've repeated several times thus far, I have done my due diligence to work with administration to give a recommendation for the fee."

The amendments passed in a 9-4 vote, with the full fee schedule then approved unanimously.

### Hiawatha Academy Bond Issuance

The council debated approving a bond issuance for Hiawatha Academy, a charter school. Some council members expressed concerns about supporting charter schools over public schools.

Council Member Wonsley argued: "We want to acknowledge the fact they're public to the extent they have a board of directors. And which no other public school has. They have a board of directors that often do include outside entities or also you know, different interests."

Other members felt charter schools provide important options, especially for immigrant communities. Council Member Jenkins stated: "We need public schools and we need other options for our young people to learn."

The bond issuance was approved in a 7-6 vote.

### Lakeshore Care Interim Use Permit

The council discussed an interim use permit for a recoupment care facility at 918 West Lake Street. Some concerns were raised about room sizes and community impact, but most members felt the conditions added addressed key issues.

Vice President Chughtai, who represents the ward, stated: "Making sure that every person has a safe place to recover and receive medical care that they need is something I would want for myself. I think we'd all for our loved ones. And should want for unhoused residents, too."

The permit was approved 11-2.

### High 5 Tobacco License

Council Member Cashman expressed frustration that a tobacco shop was opening at a former gas station site that has been problematic for the neighborhood, but acknowledged there was no legal basis to deny the license.

Cashman stated: "I'll still be voting no on this license today to let all the stakeholders know that I personally do not support the use for the site."

The license was approved 11-2.

### Blue Line Light Rail Extension

The council passed a resolution approving preliminary design plans for the Blue Line light rail extension. Council members representing affected areas expressed cautious support while emphasizing ongoing concerns about impacts.

Council Member Vetaw stated: "I want us, 20 years from now, to still be proud of the work that has happened on this project and the city's involvement in it."

The resolution passed unanimously with an amendment adding language about specific community concerns.

### Navigation Center Legislative Directive

Council Member Chavez introduced a legislative directive requesting a report on the former Navigation Center for homeless residents and potential new locations. This sparked debate about the effectiveness of the previous center and best approaches to addressing homelessness.

Council Member Osman argued: "I think throwing our hands up and saying let's not do anything is not a solution. We have to do something about it."

Others felt it was duplicative of recent reports. Council Member Jenkins stated: "We literally just had a presentation in the BIZ committee about the former navigation site. We know how much it costs: $3 million. We know how it was established."

The directive passed 10-3.
