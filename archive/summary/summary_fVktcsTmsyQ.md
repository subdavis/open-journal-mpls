## Discussion

### Pennhurst Residential Street Resurfacing Project
Discussion focused on the pavement condition index (PCI) of 45, which staff indicated was appropriate for resurfacing (anything below 60 qualifies). The project will extend street life by approximately 10 years. Assessment rates and deferment options for seniors, disabled residents, and veterans were discussed. Passed unanimously.

### Franklin Avenue Reconstruction Project
Extensive discussion about the removal of a westbound left-turn lane at 4th Avenue, with significant concern from local businesses. County staff explained the decision was based on space constraints, safety considerations, and overall corridor priorities. The project includes full reconstruction, new pedestrian ramps, sidewalks, bike facilities, and utility improvements.

Notable quote from Hennepin County Project Manager Nathan Ellingson: "We acknowledge that not all elements of the project are going to be agreeable to everyone. We do believe that the project design... is reflective of the project goals that we've established through multiple years of public engagement and stakeholder engagement."

Council Member Osman raised concerns about assessment impacts on non-profits serving low-income residents. Staff clarified that assessments can be spread over 20 years. Passed unanimously.

## Public Comments

### Electric Fetus (Aaron and Stephanie)
Objected to both assessment and redesign, particularly the removal of left-turn lane. Noted they conducted their own traffic study showing over 500 cars using the turn lane. Expressed concern about business access and emergency vehicle response times. Questioned validity of county's traffic study conducted during pandemic.

### Steve Mogel (1924 4th Avenue South)
Criticized overall redevelopment plan, citing 16-20,000 daily vehicles versus minimal bicycle/pedestrian traffic. Reported recent vehicle crashes into his building and requested additional parking/loading zones. Expressed concern about traffic flow issues.

### Joan Little (2001 Stevens)
Objected to assessment on family-owned four-plex and adjacent lot (2007 Stevens). Raised concerns about loss of yard space, fence removal, off-street parking, and retaining wall destruction. Noted potential hardship for limited-income tenants if rent increases needed to cover assessment costs.
