### Council Tracking Report

City Clerk Casey Carl presented the first Council Tracking Report, covering ordinances, enterprise policies, and legislative directives from January 1 to August 1, 2024. The report aims to increase transparency and accountability between the Council and the City's administration.

Key points from the presentation:
- 48 legislative proposals were introduced in the first seven months of 2024, doubling the volume from previous years
- 5 enterprise policies were adopted
- 20 legislative directives were issued, with 13 approved by the Mayor

Council members expressed appreciation for the report and its potential to improve collaboration between the legislative and executive branches. Council President Payne emphasized the importance of building trust and transparency in the new government structure:

> "This is really about having more transparency and accountability in our governance system and that we have baked it into the process that creates that accountability, that transparency, and ultimately trust."

The report was received and filed without objection.

### Community Commission on Police Oversight Bylaws

City Clerk Casey Carl presented the proposed bylaws for the Community Commission on Police Oversight (CCPO), which were approved by the CCPO on July 8, 2024. The bylaws outline the commission's purpose, structure, and operations.

The CCPO also requested an amendment to create two standing committees:
1. Police Policy Research and Recommendations Committee
2. Community Engagement Committee

Council Member Cashman inquired about the intentions of the Community Engagement Committee. Carl explained that the committee would focus on organizing public hearings, listening sessions, and promoting community awareness of the CCPO's work.
