## Discussion

### Lowry Handy Stop Extended Hours License
Neighbors expressed significant concerns about the 24-hour operation of this gas station, citing issues with crime, public safety, and previous incidents including shootings. The business has been operating 24/7 since 2007 without proper permits. Significant discussion centered around whether to approve the extended hours or enforce current legal operating hours of 6am-10pm. Multiple residents reported safety concerns, including a stray bullet incident.

Council members suggested continuing the item to allow for community dialogue between the owner and neighbors. Council Member Cashman noted: "There's room for coming to agreements with owners who are willing and ways to build relationships with their neighbors."

Decision: Motion to continue the item to next meeting passed unanimously.

### Metropolitan Transportation Network Bus Storage
Discussion focused on the impact of school bus traffic on neighboring businesses. The facility will house up to 70 buses serving Minneapolis Public Schools. The owner clarified operation hours, with first buses leaving at 4:42am and last returns by 8pm. Council members viewed the location as ideal for this use, with Council Member Ellison noting the positive impact on local employment.

Vote: Approved unanimously.

### Animal Control Ordinance Amendment
The amendment removes language requiring service animals to be "certified," bringing city code into compliance with ADA requirements. Discussion clarified that under federal law, only two questions can be asked about service animals: whether the animal is required because of a disability and what work/task the animal has been trained to perform.

Vote: Approved unanimously.

### Pimento Jamaican Kitchen License Revocation
Discussion centered around outstanding taxes owed to the Minnesota Department of Revenue. The committee moved the item forward without recommendation to allow time for the owner to resolve the tax issue before full council consideration.

Vote: Forwarded to Council without recommendation unanimously.
