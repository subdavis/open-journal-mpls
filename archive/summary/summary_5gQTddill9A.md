## Discussion

### Violence Prevention Funding Transfer
Contentious debate over Council Member Wonsley's proposal to move GVI (Group Violence Intervention) and YGVI (Youth Group Violence Intervention) funding to Hennepin County. The discussion revealed deep divisions over the Neighborhood Safety Department's effectiveness and management. Commissioner Barnette made public statements suggesting council members were trying to benefit specific nonprofits, leading to heated exchanges. After extensive debate, the proposal was postponed indefinitely.

Notable quote from CM Wonsley: "The Neighborhood Safety Department is not functional. And that dysfunction has simply put residents' safety at risk. In 2024 homicides decreased across the country, while they increased here in Minneapolis."

Vote: Motion to postpone indefinitely passed 13-0

### George Floyd Square Layout
Debate centered on whether to proceed with the city's recommended concept layout or explore a pedestrian mall option. CM Jenkins strongly opposed any delay, citing years of community engagement. CM Cashman advocated for further study of pedestrian options. The discussion revealed tensions between different visions for the space and questions of council member deference to ward representatives.

Quote from CM Jenkins: "I see this as a delay in progress at George Floyd Square. There have been hundreds of hours of community engagement over the past 4.5 years."

Vote on referral to clerk: 8-5
Vote on legislative directive: 9-4

### Energy Franchise Agreements
Council approved new franchise agreements with Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy, along with Clean Energy Partnership memorandums. Discussion focused on the city's climate goals and the need for utility accountability. Multiple council members praised staff work while emphasizing the agreements' importance for meeting climate targets.

Vote: 13-0

### Historic Church Demolition
Debate over demolition of a historic church at Victory Memorial Drive. CM Vetaw opposed the demolition, arguing for more time to study the property's historical significance. City Attorney clarified that staff research showed the property did not meet landmark criteria.

Vote: 9-4 in favor of granting the demolition appeal
