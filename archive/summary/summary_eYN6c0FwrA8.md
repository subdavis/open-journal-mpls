## Discussion

### MPD Staffing and Recruitment
Chief O'Hara reported current sworn staffing at 578 officers, down from previous years but with improved recruitment in 2024. The department hired 60 new sworn personnel, including 15 lateral transfers from other departments, marking the highest recruitment numbers in 10 years. However, significant challenges remain with 131 officers eligible for retirement and continued attrition. Council members expressed concern about the conversion rate from applications to hires, with only 60 hires from over 1,000 applicants.

Quote from Chief O'Hara: "I feel much better than I did when I first got here about the state of the Police Department today. I think the members that are here are incredibly resilient and dedicated to our residents and to getting this right."

### Park Board Budget Adjustments 
The Park Board announced significant operational changes due to reduced property tax collection rates, including:
- Closure of 5 ice rinks
- Recreation center closures on all major holidays
- Reduction in recreation center hours (closing at 8pm instead of 9pm)
- Elimination of Sunday hours at 5 recreation centers

Director Weisman emphasized these changes would not impact youth programming commitments and were based on usage data and staff input.

### North Commons Project Funding
Discussion centered around the City's $3 million commitment to the North Commons Park improvement project, with concerns about a potential $300,000 reduction. Council members, particularly Chair Chughtai, expressed strong support for maintaining the full funding commitment. Superintendent Bangoura indicated confidence in receiving full funding support from both the Council and Mayor.

### Emergency Communications Center Improvements
Director Hodne reported significant improvements in staffing and operations, including:
- Increase to 87% staffed positions (74 out of 85 filled)
- Improved call answer times to 83% within 15 seconds
- Integration of Radio Shop department in 2025
- Implementation of new quality assurance programs
- Success with hiring incentives and part-time staff program
