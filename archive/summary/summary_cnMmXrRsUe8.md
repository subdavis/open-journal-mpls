## Discussion

### Blue Line Light Rail Extension Preliminary Design

The committee received a presentation on the preliminary design plans for the Blue Line Light Rail Extension. Jenny Hager from Public Works outlined the project's history, benefits, and timeline. The presentation highlighted the project's potential to improve transit options, pedestrian safety, and economic development in North Minneapolis.

Council members raised concerns about safety, particularly regarding at-grade crossings and potential impacts on emergency services. Fire Chief Brian Tyner addressed these concerns, stating:

"There is going to be a designated travel lane of 16 feet which, you know, is a normal car lane but in addition to that with the embedded tracks that give us another 16 feet another 2 feet and once we get above 20 everything is a bonus. Emergency access will not be a problem."

Council members also discussed the importance of community engagement and the need for more time to absorb the project information. No vote was taken on this item.

### Additional Station at Washington and West Broadway

Council Member Ellison strongly advocated for an additional station at Washington and West Broadway, emphasizing its importance for connectivity:

"It's really important for us to continue to lean on that and I think it's really important for the project team to -- to sort of -- to engage with this demand and this request and add that stop. It's going to increase -- it's going to increase that access."

The project team acknowledged the request and indicated that they would continue to evaluate this option. No formal decision was made at this meeting.

### Antidisplacement Strategies

Meg McMahon from CPED presented an overview of antidisplacement strategies and programs. The presentation outlined existing city programs, potential partnerships with other jurisdictions, and specific needs identified for the project.

Council members expressed strong support for antidisplacement efforts but raised concerns about funding and timeline. Council President Payne requested:

"Could you work with my office so that we could maybe draft something up that reflects some of our desires for those commitments and maybe that's something that we could distribute across some of these partnerships?"

The discussion highlighted the need for collaboration between the city, county, and Metropolitan Council to address antidisplacement concerns effectively. No formal vote was taken on this item.

### Parking Issues on West Broadway

The presentation addressed concerns about parking along West Broadway, particularly around the Penn and West Broadway intersection. The city has entered into an agreement to lease land for additional surface parking, but long-term solutions, including structured parking, were discussed.

Council Member Vetaw emphasized the importance of addressing parking concerns for local businesses:

"There were several business owners here who had been in business 30, 40 years and they're extremely concerned about the parking situation and just the construction."

The committee discussed the need for both short-term and long-term parking solutions, but no formal decisions were made at this meeting.

## Public Comments

There were no specific public comments mentioned in the transcript. However, the presentation and discussion referenced feedback received from community members during previous public hearings and engagement efforts. These comments primarily focused on concerns about displacement, parking, safety, and the impact on local businesses during construction.
