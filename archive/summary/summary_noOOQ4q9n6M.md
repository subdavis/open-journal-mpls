## Discussion

### Update on the former Third Precinct building at 3000 Minnehaha Avenue

City staff presented an update on plans for the former Third Precinct building at 3000 Minnehaha Avenue. The proposal includes converting the building into a Democracy Center housing Elections and Voter Services operations, along with 8,000 square feet of community space. 

Margaret Anderson Kelliher, City Operations Officer, reported that community engagement showed 3:1 support for the Democracy Center proposal. The plan includes moving Elections and Voter Services from their current leased space to this city-owned property, which would provide cost savings and improved functionality.

Several council members expressed concerns about the proposal, particularly regarding the planned "warehouse" or "logistics center" component. Council Member Chavez stated, "When you talk about democracy center, let's talk about who is a democracy center for. And who is it leaving out? And you know what, fine. Let's build E.V.S., but a warehouse? On Lake Street in an area that has been burned to the ground because we were left abandoned by the city."

City staff attempted to clarify that the "warehouse" terminology was misleading and that the space would serve multiple functions, including storage, training, and office space for election operations. However, some council members remained skeptical about the appropriateness of this use for the site.

No vote was taken on this item, as it was an informational update.

### Resolution on public ownership and operation of the former Third Precinct site

Council Members Chavez and Wonsley introduced a resolution expressing support for full community control and development of the 3000 Minnehaha site, with the city retaining ownership for the purpose of racial healing. 

Supporters argued that this approach would better serve the community and address the site's history of racial trauma. Council Member Wonsley stated, "To return the building to the community for the purposes of racial healing and reckoning, especially with the history of the Third Precinct, while it might be an uncomfortable conversation for city leaders to have, it's one that is necessary."

Opponents, including Council Member Palmisano, argued that the proposal ignored the results of community engagement and would further delay progress on the site. She said, "We have done engagement. The community has told us what they want. When staff has come back, this council has repeatedly said, 'It's not good enough,' and we have taken votes contradictory to that feedback."

The resolution failed with 6 ayes and 7 nays.

### Resolution on development and future use of 3000 Minnehaha Avenue

Council Members Chavez, Wonsley, and Chowdhury introduced a resolution opposing the construction of a warehouse structure at 3000 Minnehaha Avenue and expressing support for using that space for community development and racial healing instead.

Supporters argued that a warehouse was inappropriate for the site and that more community space was needed. Council Member Chavez said, "I think about a future where this space can be a community-led model on how to rebuild Lake Street from the civil unrest that we experienced after we were abandoned in 2020."

City staff and some council members expressed concern about the resolution's potential impact on the Elections and Voter Services plan. City Clerk Casey Carl stated that without the logistics center, they would not be able to run elections from the site.

The resolution passed with 8 ayes and 5 nays, though there was confusion about its exact implications and whether it would prevent the proposed Elections and Voter Services center from moving forward.
