## Discussion

### Community Garden Property Sales
CPED recommended the sale of three properties to Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board for permanent community gardens. The properties are part of a larger pilot program involving 84 vacant lots. The sale price totaled $66,225. Council members raised concerns about ensuring properties weren't suitable for housing development before converting to gardens. Staff explained these lots were selected due to size limitations or soil issues making them unsuitable for development.

> "We looked at the permanent significance of the gardens, how long the gardens were in use, how effective they were being used." - Maureen, CPED Housing Supervisor

Passed by voice vote unanimously.

### Artificial Turf Appeal Hearing
Six property owners near the University of Minnesota appealed the denial of variances to allow artificial turf in front yards. The appellants argued that heavy foot traffic and clay soils made maintaining natural grass impossible. Staff recommended denying the appeal, citing concerns about drainage, maintenance, and urban heat island effects. The council debated between practical solutions for property owners and adherence to existing code.

> "Without this creative, albeit, solution, it's not possible [to maintain compliance]" - Nick, appellant representative

Vote: 4-2 to deny appeal (Rainville and Osman voting no)

### Supportive Housing Report
Staff presented findings on processes for funding transitional housing, board and lodge facilities, and emergency shelters. The report highlighted that regular ESG funding has returned to pre-pandemic levels of approximately $1 million annually, down from over $13 million in pandemic-era funding. Council members expressed concern about the housing crisis and the need for continued collaboration with Hennepin County.

Received and filed.
