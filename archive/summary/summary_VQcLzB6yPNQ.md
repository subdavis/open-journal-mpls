## Discussion

### Minneapolis Police Officers Federation Collective Bargaining Agreement

The Council voted 8-4 to approve a new contract with the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation. The contract includes significant pay raises and some management reforms, but several council members expressed concerns that it did not go far enough in terms of accountability and reform.

Council Member Wonsley, who voted against the contract, stated: "To me I don't see temporary gains for permanent raises as progress." She expressed concern that many of the changes were temporary and that the contract did not address issues like coaching and problematic hiring practices.

Council Member Ellison, who also voted no, argued that while the contract was an improvement over past agreements, "this kind of incrementalism given what our city has been through with the police department... is not what we can accept. We need bigger swings than this."

Supporters of the contract, including Council President Payne, argued that it was a necessary step to address staffing shortages and improve morale in the department. Payne stated: "We cannot solely rely on police. And we can't just do it with mental health responders. We need new approaches across the spectrum of safety."

### Budget Adjustments to Fund Police Contract 

After approving the police contract, the Council had to determine how to fund it. Vice President Chughtai presented a proposal to use money from the Downtown Assets Fund and other sources to pay for the contract while preserving funding for alternative public safety programs.

The proposal passed 7-5, but several council members expressed concerns about the rushed nature of the decision and the use of the Downtown Assets Fund. Council Member Vetaw called it a "shell game" and questioned the urgency, stating: "This is manufactured urgency. This is -- I mean, especially from a Council that is totally fine with delaying things. This is a big decision."

Council Member Palmisano argued against using the Downtown Assets Fund, saying: "The more we stray from it and it is in our list of initiatives to make some changes to that taxing district and the more we open ourselves up to future risk."

Supporters of the proposal, including Council Members Chowdhury and Wonsley, argued it was necessary to fund both the police contract and alternative safety programs. Chowdhury stated: "We're in a moment where staring down a deficit and we have to weigh needs versus wants. We need to support public safety across the board."

### Vacant Building Registration Ordinance

The Council unanimously approved changes to strengthen the city's Vacant Building Registration program. Council Member Wonsley, who authored the ordinance, explained it was designed to address chronic vacancies that create health and safety issues in neighborhoods.

Wonsley stated: "This is just one of several steps that my office is going to be taking to reduce vacancy across the city. And I look forward to continuing this work with all of you, staff and residence in the community who are impacted by this issue."

Several other council members expressed support for the ordinance as a way to address problem properties in their wards.

### Minneapolis Convention Center Remodel Project

The Council voted to refer a $13 million bid for remodeling the Minneapolis Convention Center back to committee for further review. This decision came as part of a larger debate about budget priorities and funding for the police contract.

Council Member Cashman, who had been advocating for the project, expressed disappointment but said he would "continue to fight very hard for the delivery of this project" in the coming weeks.

### Park Board Workers Support Resolution

The Council voted 11-1 to approve a symbolic resolution supporting Park Board workers who are currently on strike. Council Member Chowdhury, who authored the resolution, described it as "a greeting card that says, 'I support park workers.' A really meaningful one."

Council Member Palmisano voted against the resolution, arguing: "Our vote on this resolution comes with lots of risks, and what I see as zero tangible benefits. I will continue doing what I think is appropriate in my role as a City Council member."

### Blue Line Light Rail Extension Comments

The Council unanimously approved submitting comments to the Metropolitan Council regarding the proposed Blue Line light rail extension. Several council members, including Rainville, Vetaw, and Ellison, added specific comments about issues in their wards that they felt were not yet resolved.
