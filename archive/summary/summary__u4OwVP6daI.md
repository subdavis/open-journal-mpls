### Opioid Settlement Funds and Strategic Plan

The Health Department presented an update on the city's opioid response and plans for using settlement funds. Key points included:

- Minneapolis will receive about $18 million over 18 years from the settlement
- The 2025 budget appropriates $899,000 for opioid response
- A strategic plan is being developed with input from community members and partners
- Focus areas include prevention, treatment, recovery support, and improving coordination between government agencies
- Specific programs mentioned include Narcan vending machines, a mobile medical unit, and contracts with community organizations

Council members asked questions about the allocation of funds and metrics for measuring success. There was discussion about the need for more investment in recovery services.

Deputy Commissioner Ritchie stated: "We're just really focusing on what this plan is telling us, and then going from there, and making sure that our recommendations to you in October and the work that we do with the Mayor between now and then reflect what we saw and what we heard from community in the plan."

The presentation was received and filed without a formal vote.

### Helix Contract Discussion 

There was significant discussion about a $1 million contract with Helix Housing Services to provide housing and substance use treatment, particularly for Native American residents. Key points:

- The contract was awarded through a sole source process rather than competitive bidding
- Helix reported housing 99 individuals and opening treatment facilities
- Some council members expressed concerns about oversight and accountability
- An audit was initiated after anonymous complaints were received

Council President Payne asked: "Do you feel that we have an appropriate set of controls in place to capture or flag issues as they arise, or do you think that we need to look at our policies around this and make sure those controls are stronger so that we don't have to wait until letters come to Council members' inboxes to discover some of these things?"

Deputy Commissioner Ritchie responded that she didn't have concerns based on the documentation and site visits, but acknowledged the ongoing audit process.

No formal vote was taken, but council members indicated they would consider the discussion during upcoming budget deliberations.

### Unity Community Mediation Team Presentation

Representatives from the Unity Community Mediation Team (UCMT) presented on their work implementing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Minneapolis Police Department. Key points:

- UCMT has established 8 community sites for taking police complaints and providing mediation
- They requested $937,900 annually to fund staffing and operations at these sites
- The sites aim to build trust between communities and police by providing a safe space to file complaints
- UCMT reported success in resolving some issues through mediation before formal complaints are filed

Council members expressed general support but asked for more specific data on outcomes and activities at the sites. 

Vice Chair Wonsley stated: "I think we on the body are making sure when we're funding things, there are extractible pieces to avoid litigation or anything. So if you have that information that will be helpful."

The presentation was received and filed without a formal vote.

### Narcan Vending Machine Expansion

Deputy Commissioner Ritchie reported on plans to expand Narcan vending machines beyond the initial location at Fire Station 21:

- Working with Hennepin County on a machine for North Minneapolis 
- Considering locations in Northeast and South Minneapolis
- Exploring potential partnership with Metro Transit for machines at transit stations
- Each machine costs about $20,000 plus installation, with ongoing costs for restocking

Chair Chavez expressed strong support: "It doesn't seem to be as expensive to be honest and can save lives."

No formal vote was taken, but council members indicated support for expansion in upcoming budget discussions.

### Mobile Medical Unit and Shower Plans

Deputy Commissioner Ritchie provided updates on plans for mobile medical and hygiene services:

- A mobile medical unit is being purchased to provide services at encampments and other locations
- Plans for a mobile shower unit are on hold after bids came in much higher than expected
- The department is re-evaluating whether to purchase a unit or contract for services

Chair Chavez requested more specific cost information to inform budget discussions, stating: "I personally do think it would be effective and smart to purchase these mobile showers and figure out how we can do that."

No formal vote was taken.
