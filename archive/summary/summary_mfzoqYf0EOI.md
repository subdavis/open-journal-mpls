## Discussion

### Labor Standards Board Resolution
Intense debate over creating an advisory board for labor standards. Multiple amendments were proposed, including changing voting thresholds and board composition. Key points of contention:
- Whether sufficient community engagement had occurred
- Representation of small businesses vs workers
- Role of community stakeholders
- Timing and process concerns

Council Member Chavez argued passionately: "This is an opportunity to say to our residents that we support workers... My mother had to work three fricking jobs to barely afford rent, to barely be able to put food on the table."

Council Member Vetaw advocated for delay: "We've seen, we've had engagement from folks who have said they haven't been heard. They just wanted a public hearing."

Resolution passed 9-3.

### Civil Rights Department Oversight
Debate over whether the Labor Standards Board should be overseen by Civil Rights Department or Office of Public Service. Council Member Jenkins argued Civil Rights lacked expertise, while Vice President Chughtai countered that Civil Rights had the most relevant experience and worker trust.

Amendment failed 6-6.

### Budget Committee Salary Schedule 
Item regarding 4% raise for appointed and non-represented employees was referred back to committee. Total cost approximately $2.7 million affecting about 690 employees. Questions raised about equity with other employee groups and need for more information.

Referred back to committee 12-0.

### Affordable Housing Right of First Refusal
Mayor's veto of previously passed ordinance considered. Required 9 votes to override. Discussion focused on implementation concerns and impact on property owners.

Veto sustained 7-5.

### Lake Street Safety Center
Discussion of new safety center opening near light rail. Will provide non-emergency safety services, police report filing, and 311 services. Council members praised collaboration between departments and community partners.

Passed as part of larger committee report.
