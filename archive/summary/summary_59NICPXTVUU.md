## Discussion

### Extension of purchase agreement for East Phillips Urban Farm project

Council Member Chavez introduced a motion to extend the purchase agreement for the East Phillips Urban Farm project. The extension moves the closing deadline to September 15, 2025, and includes provisions for alternative funding if state funding is not secured. Council members expressed strong support for the community-led initiative, highlighting its importance for environmental justice and Indigenous sovereignty.

Council Member Palmisano provided historical context, noting the city's $18 million investment in the site without public benefit to date. She expressed concerns about the lack of a clear development plan but supported giving the project one more legislative session to secure funding.

Council Member Wonsley emphasized the public benefit of the community's vision, stating, "The vision that East Phillips community members have rallied around absolutely embodies a public benefit."

Council Member Chowdhury added, "This is a major generational shift of how we do work for our community and center the voices of community members in shaping what our city looks like."

The motion passed unanimously with 11 ayes.

### Approval of ShotSpotter independent evaluation

Council Member Wonsley presented an amended motion for an independent evaluation of the ShotSpotter technology. The amendment removed a specific deadline for the request for proposals. 

There was no discussion on this item, suggesting general agreement among council members on the need for an evaluation of the controversial technology.

The motion passed unanimously with 11 ayes.

### Recognition of David Herberholz's service as Director of Solid Waste and Recycling

The council recognized David Herberholz for his 12 years of service as Director of Solid Waste and Recycling. Council members praised his leadership in implementing various waste management initiatives, including city-wide organics collection and the Zero Waste Plan.

Council Member Palmisano stated, "Dave, I have not seen another, more steady public servant than you. There are many things not in the resolution that we've asked you to do."

Herberholz expressed gratitude, saying, "It's been an honor to be the Director in Minneapolis. I'm a transplant. I love this city!"

No formal vote was taken on this recognition.

### Denial of variance appeal for 3505 Irving Avenue South

Vice President Chughtai moved to deny the appeal for variances at 3505 Irving Avenue South. She explained that while she sympathized with the homeowner, the proposed changes did not meet the threshold set by city policies and codes.

Council Member Rainville expressed support for the homeowner, stating the variance was "just a minor variation off the standard rules."

Council Member Palmisano inquired about the possibility of using pervious surfaces to address the issue. Planning Director Meg McMann clarified that the city's definition of permeability excludes artificial materials, even if labeled as pervious.

The motion to deny the appeal passed with 10 ayes and 1 nay (Rainville).

### Approval of Xcel Energy franchise agreement extension

Council Member Cashman introduced a six-month extension of the franchise agreement with Xcel Energy. This extension allows for continued negotiations between the city and Xcel.

Cashman explained, "This six-month extension of our franchise agreement with Xcel will allow our city team, as well as the representatives, to keep working on the franchise agreement negotiations."

The extension passed unanimously with 11 ayes.
