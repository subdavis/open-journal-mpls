## Discussion

### Women's History Month Resolution
Opening presentation celebrated the progress of women in city leadership, noting that 8 of 13 Minneapolis council members are women, with 5 being women of color. The resolution acknowledged historical exclusions of marginalized groups and committed to continued support for women's advancement. Passed unanimously.

### Mayor's Veto Override - George Floyd Square Study
Council voted to override Mayor Frey's veto of a legislative directive requesting further study of the pedestrian plaza concept for George Floyd Square. The override passed 9-4, with significant tension around the implications for project timeline and community impact.

Quote from Council Member Jenkins: "This delay will drive up the cost, delay the work until maybe 2026, and there will always be disagreements in any community and any society, always. It is our responsibility to demonstrate leadership and make unpopular decisions when the data leads us to these decisions."

### Boulevard Gardening Ordinance
Extensive debate over amendments to allow raised planting beds without permits and clarify regulations about plant types and mulch requirements. Discussion centered on accessibility for renters and low-income residents versus safety and maintenance concerns. Multiple amendments were proposed and adopted, including specifics about acceptable mulch types and clarification about thorny plants. Passed 13-0 after amendments.

### YGVI and GVI Contracts
Heated debate over contracts for violence intervention programs. Some council members pushed for delay to get more performance metrics and accountability measures, while others argued any delay would disrupt crucial services. Motion to delay failed 5-7-1. Final approval passed 10-1-2.

Quote from Council Member Wonsley: "The Neighborhood Safety Department has not only outlined a transition plan. What are they going to do with the clients with the previous GVI and YGVI contractor? How will they support the continuation of services when you don't have a program manager for this specific work and a director?"

### George Floyd Pedestrian Mall
Introduction of ordinance was postponed to December 11, 2024, due to required findings of fact not being ready. Significant debate about the symbolism and practical implications of different design approaches. Postponement passed with 4 opposing votes.

## Public Comments
There were disruptions during the meeting that required two recesses, but specific public comments were not clearly captured in the transcript.
