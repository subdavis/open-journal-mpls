## Discussion

### Data Practices Program Overview
Christian from the City Clerk's office presented a detailed analysis of the city's data practices program, highlighting significant growth in requests (10-14% annually) and operational challenges. The presentation revealed how the system evolved from using "post-it notes on a wall" to a comprehensive digital tracking system. Key concerns included sustainability of growth rates and department-level data management capabilities.

Chair Wonsley raised questions about fees for data requests, noting a previous council directive to work toward eliminating fees. Christian indicated plans to update the 2018 fee policy in 2025.

Quote from Chair Wonsley: "I think there's interest among the body to learn how the Clerk is trying to move the particular work forward."

The committee expressed strong support for the progress made while acknowledging ongoing challenges. Passed by voice vote.

### Special Primary Election Preparation
Katie Smith presented on the January 14, 2025 special primary election preparations, indicating 85-90% of election judge positions were filled. The election was called following a senator's death, with early voting starting January 9. The presentation focused on ensuring adequate staffing and public awareness. Passed unanimously by voice vote.

### Partnership Engagement Fund
Vice Chair Palmisano questioned changes to the fund's criteria regarding community benefit requirements. Steve Gallagher clarified that the changes were made to comply with Minnesota Public Purpose Law and didn't substantially alter the program's operations. The item was included in the consent agenda and passed.

### Workers' Compensation Settlement
The settlement for Troy Walker resulted in a tied vote (2-2), with Chughtai and Wonsley voting against, and Vetaw and Palmisano voting in favor. The item was forwarded to the full City Council without recommendation.
