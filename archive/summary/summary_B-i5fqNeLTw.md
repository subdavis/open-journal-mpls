## Discussion

### Police Response to Moturi Shooting
Extended discussion initiated by Council President Payne regarding the police response to the shooting of David Moturi and the department's handling of his alleged attacker over 8 months. Multiple council members expressed concern about racial disparities in police response. Councilmember Wonsley noted "eight months of inaction" and questioned the different treatment between this case and others involving mental health crises.

Councilmember Rainville cautioned against rushing to judgment, while Councilmember Ellison emphasized the pattern of differential treatment: "MPD always seems to find a way to deescalate with a white suspect, and when the suspect is Black, it's a killing."

Council members called for an independent after-action review rather than just an internal investigation. 

Quote from Councilmember Chowdhury: "Across the street right now the public hearing for Mr. Sawchak is happening, and so it's grounding us in the reality that we have our work cut out for us."

No formal vote taken as this was a discussion item.

### Boards and Commissions Reform Implementation
City Clerk Carl presented comprehensive update on reforms to city boards and commissions, including classification of all bodies into tiers, standardization of bylaws and rules, and development of participant agreements. Discussion focused on potential sunsetting of inactive boards and improving effectiveness of active ones.

Councilmember Palmisano noted: "We cannot keep adding to these over time without the courage to remove ones that have perhaps run out their ability for their recommendations to come forward in meaningful ways."

Plans include potential consolidation of appointment cycles and improved training and support for board members. Passed by voice vote.

### Oversight & Evaluation Division Update
Extensive presentation and discussion about the role and work plan of the new Oversight & Evaluation Division. Multiple council members expressed confusion about how to access the division's services and requested more concrete examples of their work.

Councilmember Vetaw particularly pressed for clarification: "I'm having -- I just struggle to understand, like, how this works out for Ward 4."

The division outlined their approach to improving Request for Committee Actions (RCAs) and supporting council oversight functions, with a development timeline extending through 2025. Report filed without formal vote.
