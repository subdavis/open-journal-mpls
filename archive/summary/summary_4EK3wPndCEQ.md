## Discussion

### Civil Rights Commission Amendment
The committee discussed an ordinance amendment to temporarily expand the pool of civilians eligible to serve on police misconduct review panels by including Civil Rights Commissioners. City Clerk Karl explained this would help address a backlog of approximately 202 cases needing review. The temporary expansion would expire December 31, 2025.

Council President Payne noted this was an interim solution while working on more comprehensive amendments: "We're hoping to have a throughput through our review panels that the current level of commissions could handle. But the ordinance is going to allow for us to flex to a higher member number so we can move more cases through panels."

Vote: Approved unanimously

### Office of Community Safety Update
Assistant Chief Gators presented significant crime reductions in Q1 2025:
- 47% reduction in robberies
- 40% reduction in carjackings
- 32% reduction in gunshot wound victims
- 24% reduction in auto thefts
- 11% reduction in aggravated assaults

The department credited data-led policing efforts and new initiatives like the Curfew Task Force. Extensive discussion occurred around staffing improvements, with MPD noting they had hired 42 officers so far in 2025 compared to 68 for all of 2024.

Vice Chair Wonsley raised questions about the sustainability of community partnerships and proper contract structures for the Curfew Task Force program. Director Harrington acknowledged these needed to be formalized: "The curfew task force in place with the police on their own will continue until we have the community partners in place. That's a matter of negotiations with the individual partners."

### Neighborhood Safety Department Reorganization
Deputy Director Lakes presented on departmental priorities including achieving full staffing, implementing financial management practices, and enhancing contract management. Significant discussion centered on new positions being created and the roles of various staff members.

Vice Chair Wonsley expressed concerns about proper training and coordination: "Hearing a lot of focus around contract management. But making sure staff have a baseline understanding of each program... there's been a lot of confusion around what is YGVI, GVI, how it differs from MinneapolUS."
