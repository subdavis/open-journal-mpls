## Discussion

### Safe and Thriving Communities Report Implementation
Vice Chair Wonsley raised concerns about the City Attorney's recent opinion that the Council cannot formally adopt action plans. This sparked significant debate about the separation of powers and the Council's role in planning. Council President Payne questioned the logic of this interpretation:

>"It's seemingly incoherent to me that we have this type of opinion in light of the 2040 Plan which is mandated by state statute... I think there's a real risk of setting some precedents here and a lot unfigured out about this new government structure."

The item was postponed to January 8, 2025 to allow more time to address these governance questions. Vote: Unanimous approval

### NYU Policing Project Analysis 
Alex Heaton presented findings showing Minneapolis has strong alternative response programs but could expand them significantly. Analysis showed:
- BCR (Behavioral Crisis Response) successfully handled 67% of eligible calls
- Potential exists to divert up to 47% of police calls to alternative responders
- Recommendations included expanding traffic control, online reporting, and mediation services
- Need for better coordination and data sharing between agencies

No vote required - presentation received and filed.

### Community Mediation Partnership Discussion
Extensive discussion occurred regarding the new partnership between MPD and NAACP for neighborhood dispute mediation. Chair Chavez raised concerns about liability and process:

>"If we're not funding this partnership with the NAACP, but did say we're doing the program... folks that have property line dispute issues are being told it's not the role of city government... what are we going to do to mitigate risk in the city comprise with this program?"

Chief O'Hara clarified this would be voluntary and community-based, but several council members requested more formal documentation of the program structure. No vote required.
