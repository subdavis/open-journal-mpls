## Discussion

### Affordable Housing Preservation Ordinance
Extended debate over new ordinance giving qualified organizations (QOs) right of first refusal when certain rental properties are sold. Main concerns centered on impact on first-time homebuyers and potential market restrictions. Two amendments passed: one regarding owner occupancy requirements and another adjusting AMI requirements from 60% to 50%. 

Councilmember Osman expressed concern about impact on low-income homebuyers: "I really want to promote homeownership... it's very challenging and tough already in the market for low-income families that are trying to get in the market."

Councilmember Ellison defended the ordinance: "The market as currently constructed produces disparities that we see now... I look at the market, it's currently constructed and I say I see a lot of disparity."

Moved forward without recommendation to full council (Vote: 5-0)

### Cannabis Business Zoning Regulations
Discussion focused on buffer zones between dispensaries and schools, with amendments proposed to reduce distances from 500 to 300 feet and minimum commercial area from 5 to 3 acres. Debate centered on balancing accessibility with community concerns.

Significant attention paid to social equity considerations and opportunities for local business owners. The state will allow minimum of 34 licenses in Minneapolis, with special consideration for social equity applicants through 2026.

Amendments passed to reduce buffer zones and minimum acreage requirements. Final ordinance passed as amended (Vote: 5-0)
