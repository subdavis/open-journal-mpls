## Discussion

### Utility Franchise Agreements and Clean Energy Partnership
The committee reviewed new 10-year franchise agreements with Xcel Energy and Centerpoint Energy, along with updated Clean Energy Partnership memoranda of understanding. Key improvements include:
- First-ever Minneapolis-specific emissions reduction commitments from both utilities
- New service quality and equity metrics
- $100,000 annual permit fees from each utility
- Enhanced coordination and communication requirements

While the agreements represent progress, several council members expressed concern that the commitments fall short of the city's climate goals, particularly Centerpoint's 20-30% emissions reduction target versus the city's more ambitious targets.

Council Member Chowdhury noted: "I refuse to be frustrated as I am today about the failure to meet the climate action goals that have been set...it's unacceptable to enrich oneself through pollution and the destruction of the environment."

The agreements received strong public support despite acknowledged limitations, with many speakers urging approval while maintaining pressure for stronger action.

Vote: Passed unanimously

### George Floyd Square Concept Layout
The committee considered a motion to place the concept layout on file while exploring a pedestrian plaza design. This sparked significant debate about the project's timeline and community engagement process.

Council Member Jenkins strongly opposed the delay: "We are literally saying to hundreds and hundreds of constituents who have showed up over hours and hours and hours over many years that we don't care what you think."

Council Member Chavez defended the motion: "We are choosing a pathway forward...We're not trying to stop construction. We are saying if we move forward with a pedestrian mall plan and we work together, we can get this done."

Vice Chair Koski requested a comprehensive review of the project's timeline, spending, and integration with other initiatives.

Vote: 4-2 (Vetaw, Koski opposed)
