## Discussion

### Street Lighting Copper Wire Theft

Joel Luhring from Public Works presented an update on copper wire theft affecting street lighting. Key points:

- The city has about 22,000 street lights, with over 2,100 outage reports annually
- Copper theft has increased significantly since 2022, with 7.5 miles of wire replaced in 2024 so far
- Mitigation strategies include using aluminum wire, which is less valuable to thieves
- Challenges include frozen conduits in winter and repeated thefts in some areas

Council members expressed concern about the impact on public safety and equity. Council Member Osman asked about addressing dark areas in neighborhoods where residents may not report outages:

"There are neighborhoods that are darker that create unsafe conditions for the residents of Minneapolis. And they, you know, we're not getting the 311 reports that the lights are out. Residents are not volunteering the language because lack of barrier of language or not knowing what 311 is. What is the plan on addressing that issue?"

No vote was taken on this item.

### Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) Air Pollution Impacts

Jenny Lansing from the Health Department presented an analysis of air pollution impacts from HERC:

- Overall emissions in Hennepin County are dominated by mobile and non-point sources
- Cancer and non-cancer risks from HERC emissions are below Minnesota Department of Health guidelines
- HERC contributes to some pollutants like hydrochloric acid and dioxins

Council members questioned the methodology and expressed concerns about cumulative impacts and environmental justice issues. Chair Cashman asked:

"Can you address any public health implications of living near the HERC, asthma, early death due to pollution. Is that considered?"

No vote was taken on this item.

### Zero Waste Policy Presentation

Ashley from the Policy and Research Team presented a landscape analysis of zero waste policies in other cities:

- Cities use various metrics, with diversion rate being most common
- Funding and enforcement are crucial for effective implementation
- Common policies include mandatory recycling/composting, deconstruction requirements, and plastic bag bans
- Innovative programs include food recovery efforts and reuse centers

No vote was taken on this item.

## Public Comments

The majority of public comments focused on the HERC closure resolution:

Stefanie Booker: Criticized the city's analysis for not accounting for localized impacts in North Minneapolis, citing high asthma rates.

Rose Brewer: Emphasized the long history of environmental injustice and called for HERC's shutdown.

Nicole (student): Argued that HERC's existence inhibits progress on zero waste initiatives at the University of Minnesota.

Doug (Ph.D. risk assessment scientist): Challenged the county's risk assessment methodology, stating that cancer risks are higher for nearby residents.

Luke Nordqvist (Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy): Emphasized HERC's climate impacts and called for a transition to zero waste policies.

Karen Clark: Urged the council to include strong commitments in the resolution, including shutting down HERC by the end of 2025 and providing restitution for affected communities.

Multiple nurses and health professionals spoke about the health impacts they've observed in communities near HERC.

Frank Hornstein (State Representative): Expressed strong support for the resolution and highlighted past instances where city council action influenced county decisions on waste management.

Many other residents, activists, and community leaders spoke in favor of closing HERC by 2025 and transitioning to zero waste policies, citing environmental justice, public health, and climate concerns.
