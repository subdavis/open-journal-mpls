### Minneapolis Public Schools Presentation
The bulk of the meeting focused on a comprehensive presentation from MPS leadership about the state of the district and opportunities for partnership with the city. Key points included:

1. Budget and Enrollment Challenges:
- MPS currently serves over 30,000 students with nearly 6,000 employees
- Only 58% of eligible Minneapolis students currently attend MPS
- District faces significant budget shortfall for 2025-26 school year
- Chronic underfunding from state level continues to impact operations

2. Support for Immigrant Students:
- Significant increase in Spanish-speaking students (23% of student body)
- Every school now has new-to-country students
- 86% of newly enrolled Spanish speakers require English Language services

3. Student Homelessness:
- 30% increase in student homelessness last year
- 20% of student body has experienced homelessness during their education
- Stable Homes Stable Schools program has served over 5,000 children
- Disproportionate impact on students of color, particularly Indigenous and Hispanic/Latino students

Council members expressed strong support for partnership with MPS, with multiple members emphasizing the need to "lock arms" in addressing funding challenges. Councilmember Chavez notably emphasized concerns about potential school closures disproportionately affecting communities of color:

>"The last thing I want to have is a conversation about schools closing, and when school, that conversation about schools closing is always in areas of communities of color, it's areas where immigrant children study and learn, and it's never about Southwest Minneapolis."

No formal votes were taken as this was an informational presentation.
