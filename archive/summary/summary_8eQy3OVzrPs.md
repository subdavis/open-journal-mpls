## Discussion

### TAP INN Liquor and Entertainment License

The committee discussed the application for TAP INN, a proposed bar and restaurant in North Minneapolis. The applicant, Chris, presented the concept as a community incubator space with food and beverage offerings. Several community members spoke in support, citing the positive impact of Chris's previous projects. However, some concerns were raised about potential noise and the impact on the neighborhood.

Council Member Ellison expressed reservations based on the applicant's involvement with Bell Lofts, a previous project that resulted in tenant displacement. He stated, "When things go wrong, when it is not just easy going, are we going to see a level of responsibility and a level of accountability that the North Side deserves?"

The committee ultimately voted to forward the item to the full Council without recommendation. The vote was 4-2 in favor of moving it forward without recommendation.

### Minneapolis Homes Down Payment Assistance Program Changes

Staff presented proposed changes to the Minneapolis Homes down payment assistance program. The changes aim to increase access and align with best practices. Key updates include:

- Limiting eligibility to first-time homebuyers
- Requiring financial wellness education
- Expanding eligible properties to include 1-4 unit buildings
- Adjusting assistance amounts based on area median income

Council members expressed support for the changes and asked clarifying questions about eligibility and fund layering. Council Member Ellison noted, "I have been here almost six years and just continue to be really impressed by this program and housing team in general."

The committee unanimously approved the staff recommendations.

### Owner-Occupied Rehab Program Updates

Staff presented updates to the owner-occupied rehab program, which provides home improvement financing to low-income homeowners. Key changes include:

- Simplifying the application process
- Increasing flexibility in funding options
- Adding a temporary relocation policy for health and safety renovations

The committee unanimously approved the staff recommendations without significant discussion.

### Rental Payment Methods Legislative Directive

Staff presented research and analysis on potential regulations for rental payment methods. The presentation covered topics such as cash acceptance requirements, electronic payment portals, and fee prohibitions. 

Council Member Osman expressed interest in requiring landlords to offer multiple payment options, stating, "I understand the cash part of it and so many complicated ways that is to work with that and the challenges of that and also this question is for to give two or three options, for example."

The committee received and filed the report, with the understanding that further stakeholder engagement and analysis would be needed before developing specific regulations.

### Appeal of Heritage Preservation Commission Decision

The committee heard an appeal from property owners at 4708 Emerson Avenue South regarding a Heritage Preservation Commission decision about a window alteration. The owners argued that the proposed changes were minor and consistent with other homes in the historic district.

Council Member Rainville moved to grant the appeal, with Chair Goodman adding, "Anyone looking at this would think we were ridiculous if we suggested what was in red is better than what is shown as the addition. Most people would say this is mere inches. Why are we harassing these owners?"

The committee voted unanimously to grant the appeal.

## Public Comments

Several members of the public spoke in support of the TAP INN project:

- Denisha Gibson, Executive Director of Cleveland Neighborhood Association, expressed support for the project as a safe space that would add value to the community.
- Steven Johnson, a local artist, spoke about how Chris's previous projects had positively impacted his career and provided opportunities for Black and Brown youth.
- Jade Robinson, a business owner, emphasized the importance of having accessible spaces for local organizations in North Minneapolis.

There were also comments from neighbors concerned about potential noise and changes to the neighborhood character.

For the Heritage Preservation Commission appeal, the property owners and their architect presented their case, emphasizing the minor nature of the proposed changes and the support they had received from other homeowners in the historic district.
