## Discussion

### Extension of Pre-Eviction Notice Period

The committee discussed an ordinance to extend the required pre-eviction notice period from 14 to 30 days. Council Member Chowdhury, one of the authors, argued that the extension would give renters more time to secure emergency rental assistance or make alternative arrangements. Some concerns were raised about the impact on small landlords, but supporters emphasized the importance of preventing homelessness and aligning with county emergency assistance timelines.

Council Member Jenkins expressed concern: "There are numbers of residents in this community that are in those same situations. And we should be aware of the unintended consequences that our policies can impose on people."

Council Member Ellison countered: "Let's all do our part in making sure that tenants are stabilized, that resources are available to tenants who are under crisis can adequately get out the door."

The ordinance passed with 5 ayes and 1 abstention.

### Lakeshore Care Inc. Interim Use Permit

A contentious public hearing was held regarding an interim use permit for Lakeshore Care Inc. to operate a recuperative care facility at 918 West Lake Street. The facility would provide short-term housing and care for individuals experiencing homelessness who are recovering from medical procedures or illnesses.

Many local business owners and residents expressed strong opposition, citing concerns about safety, property values, and the impact on the neighborhood. Supporters argued for the need for such services and criticized the "not in my backyard" mentality.

After extensive discussion, Council Member Rainville moved to delay the decision for one cycle to allow for a meeting between the applicant and local business owners. The motion passed unanimously.

### NEON Food Incubator Project Land Sale

The committee approved a land sale and development agreement with the Northside Economic Opportunity Network (NEON) for a food incubator project. The project involves constructing a two-story commercial facility with shared kitchens, retail space, and office areas. The sale includes portions of city-owned parcels at fair market value, with provisions for soil remediation costs.

Council Member Ellison expressed strong support: "The Northside is something I care about. I know it's something we all care about. And the corridor, and the development of this corridor is critically important to the folks on the Northside."

The motion passed unanimously.

### Modification of TIF Districts

Angie Skoldom presented a proposal to modify the budgets of three Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts to increase their capacity for pooling funds. The modifications would result in an additional $9.4 million available for eligible budgeting purposes over the next three years.

The proposal passed unanimously without significant discussion.
