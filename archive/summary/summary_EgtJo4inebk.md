## Discussion

### Boulevard Ordinance Amendment
The committee discussed significant changes to the boulevard ordinance to allow food growing and gardens. Main points of contention centered around permitting requirements for raised beds and fruit-bearing shrubs. Councilmember Chowdhury and Chair Cashman expressed concerns about permits creating barriers, especially for non-English speakers and residents in Green Zones.

> "I personally don't think that we should require permits for shrubs. I don't think we should require permits for raised beds. I think permits are a barrier and our goal here is to encourage people to use the boulevard to beautify the boulevard, to plant and grow food in the boulevard, and any kind of permitting process bureaucracy is going to be a barrier," said Chair Cashman.

The committee voted to delay the ordinance for one cycle to clarify language around fruit-bearing shrubs and consider removing permit requirements. Motion passed unanimously.

### Transportation Action Plan Progress Report
Kathleen presented a comprehensive update on the TAP implementation, highlighting:
- 40% completion of 100-mile pedestrian improvement goal
- 30% completion of intersection improvements
- 12 of 25 transit priority projects completed
- Reduction in vehicle miles traveled by 225 million miles per year (goal is 500 million)
- Equity metrics showing investments in Transportation Equity Priority Areas matching or exceeding citywide rates

Report was received and filed without objection.
