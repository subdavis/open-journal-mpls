## Discussion

### Resolution Supporting Campus Activism
Council Member Wonsley introduced a resolution supporting nonviolent campus activism at the University of Minnesota and urging authorities to drop charges against protesters arrested during Palestine-related demonstrations. The resolution highlighted concerns about criminalization of protest and drew parallels to historical social movements. Debate focused on the appropriate role of the city in university matters and protest rights versus public safety concerns.

Quote from CM Wonsley: "I don't want to see the City Council be complicit in criminalizations of students engaging in nonviolent anti-war protests. I think it's crucial that we draw a clear line that the criminalization and nonviolent protests underlies free speech and democracy."

Vote: Passed 7-5

### MPD Internal Affairs Investigation Contract 
Commissioner Barnette presented a contract with DLG Consulting to help clear a significant backlog of internal affairs cases and force reviews. The department currently has 142 investigations in backlog, with some cases over 1,000 days old. The contract aims to clear the backlog by March 2025 to meet settlement agreement requirements.

Vote: Passed unanimously

### Police Training Services Contract
Commander Brown gave an extensive presentation on a contract with Exceptional Edge Consulting to develop and deliver new training programs required by the settlement agreement. The training will integrate stop/search/arrest procedures with non-discriminatory policing concepts using evidence-based methods that showed success in other departments. Multiple council members expressed strong support for the comprehensive approach and Commander Brown's leadership.

Quote from Commander Brown: "I can tell you that the people that are wanting to be in our training division are there because they're committed to the change. They're committed to bringing about the best training for MPD."

Vote: Passed unanimously

### OPCR Complaint Process Improvements
Council Member Chavez introduced a legislative directive requiring the Office of Police Conduct Review to provide a detailed report on improvements to their complaint intake process, handling procedures, and measures to address case backlogs. The report is due February 2025.

Vote: Passed unanimously
