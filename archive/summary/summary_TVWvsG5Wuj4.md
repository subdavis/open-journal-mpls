### Contract Amendment with Danny Murphy Consulting, LLC

Jared Jeffries from the Office of Community Safety presented a contract amendment for Danny Murphy Consulting, LLC. The original contract, capped at $300,000, was for expert witness services through the City Attorney's Office. The amendment proposes to:

1. Increase the contract cap by $600,000 to a total of $900,000
2. Extend the contract through the end of 2025
3. Transition the contract from the City Attorney's Office to the Office of Community Safety

Jeffries highlighted Mr. Murphy's extensive experience with consent decrees in cities like New Orleans and Baltimore, and his valuable expertise in implementing the terms of the consent decree and settlement agreement in Minneapolis.

Council President Payne expressed support for the transition, stating:

"We should be really structuring our tools and expertise and talent in the places that they need to be for the long term, and that was why [we're moving this] into OCS because we know that's going to be where a lot of this implementation work will ultimately be housed."

The item passed unanimously with no further discussion.

Vote: Passed unanimously
