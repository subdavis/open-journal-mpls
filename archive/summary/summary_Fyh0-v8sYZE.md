## Discussion

### George Floyd Square Redevelopment
The city presented comprehensive plans for redeveloping George Floyd Square, including street reconstruction, memorial preservation, and community space design. The presentation outlined three potential concepts: a pedestrian plaza, transit mall, or flexible open space. Staff recommended the flexible open design, which would allow for both regular traffic flow and closure for events.

Council members were deeply divided on the proposal. Council Member Jenkins supported moving forward, citing years of community engagement and the urgent need for infrastructure improvements. Council Member Chavez strongly opposed the plan, stating:

"This isn't just a corner... I do not support the city's plan. I believe that we can find a new pathway forward... We only have one shot to get this right."

Council Member Cashman requested a delay in the decision, though staff indicated this could push the project to 2026. No formal action was taken, with further discussion scheduled for the next day.

### Settlement Agreement Legislative Directive
Council Member Wonsley presented a legislative directive regarding implementation of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights settlement agreement. The directive requests the City Attorney's Office provide regular updates starting January 2025 on implementation progress and the role of the independent evaluator. Passed by voice vote.

## Public Comments
The majority of public comments focused on the shooting of Davis Moturi and MPD's handling of John Sawchak case:

Dave Bicking (Communities United Against Police Brutality) - Called for an independent third-party investigation of MPD's handling of the Sawchak matter, emphasizing the need for a neutral expert with no prior city contracts.

Brenda Short - Expressed frustration with continued police violence post-George Floyd, demanded removal of both the Mayor and Police Chief.

Janet and Dave Pickens - Detailed the timeline of Sawchak's harassment of neighbors and MPD's failure to act despite multiple reports and warrants.

Janelle Austin Bryant - Connected Moturi shooting to systemic racism in Minneapolis, called for fundamental changes to public safety.

Multiple other speakers echoed similar themes of police accountability, systemic racism, and the need for concrete changes rather than incremental reforms.

Later comments focused on George Floyd Square redevelopment:

Aliza Wesley ("Gate Keeper") - Criticized city's approach to George Floyd Square planning, emphasized need for community-led process.

Several residents expressed concern about displacement and gentrification potentially resulting from the reconstruction project.
