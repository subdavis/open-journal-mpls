## Discussion

### JPMorgan Chase Variance Appeal
Initially approved but later reconsidered after extensive debate about the quasi-judicial role of the council. The discussion centered on whether making exceptions for large corporations while strictly enforcing rules for residents was appropriate. Councilmember Ellison argued strongly for consistency in applying ordinances:

>"If we're going to say that the rules are flexible for JPMorgan Chase, then I put on the tab that we should -- I would move to reconsider Catherine Hill. If the rules don't matter for JPMorgan Chase, then the rules shouldn't matter."

The debate became heated at times, with Councilmember Rainville calling the reconsideration "vindictive." After reconsideration, the variance was denied (8-5 vote), with council members noting that a legislative pathway would be available by summer to allow such signage.

### Catherine Hill Variance Reconsideration
Following the JPMorgan Chase discussion, there was an attempt to reconsider the Catherine Hill variance decision. Councilmember Vetaw strongly objected to reopening the matter, expressing concern about putting the family through additional stress. The motion to reconsider ultimately failed unanimously (13-0), maintaining the original partial approval of variances.

### Pro-Life Action Ministries Settlement
Approved settlement of claims and attorney fees in litigation matter of Pro-Life Action Ministries vs. City of Minneapolis. While details of the settlement were not discussed in open session, the matter was approved unanimously (13-0).

### Council Staff and Oversight Functions
President Payne and Vice President Chughtai introduced an ordinance to update provisions related to Council staff and policy, research, and oversight functions. New City Auditor Robert Timerman was present and agreed to provide written feedback before the March 25th public hearing. The introduction was approved unanimously (13-0).

### Department of Justice Settlement Amendment
Amendment to Council Action 2024A-0867 regarding settlement with the Department of Justice concerning the Minneapolis Police Department. While specific details weren't discussed in open session, the amendment was approved unanimously (13-0).
